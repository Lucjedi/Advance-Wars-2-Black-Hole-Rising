Macro Land, onde o punho de#ferro do exército de Black Hole#esmagou toda a oposição. Nas#demais áreas, seu controle está#cada dia maior...
Hawke! Venha até mim.$0f
As suas ordens, $0emeu senhor Sturm.$0f
Como está a invasão de Macro Land?$0f
Excelente, meu senhor.$0fOs outros COs acabam de#terminar suas operações.$0f
Nosso objetivo está claro, $0enão está?$0f
Estabelecer uma base de operações#de Black Hole aqui em Wars World.$0f
Sim.$0fRecentemente, fui instigador de um#grande conflito bélico entre os$0fpaíses desta região.$0fMeu objetivo era conquistá-los em#meio à distúrbios.$0e$0e Eu fracassei.$0f
Isso foi em Cosmo Land,$0e#não foi meu senhor?$0f
Não cometerei o mesmo erro#de novo.$0fDesta vez, tenho uma base e#invadirei ao seu prazer.$0fPara isso, $0epreciso de materiais#e dinheiro...$0f
Não se preocupe meu senhor.#$0eOs COs conhecem suas ordens.$0fTransportarão tudo o que desejar#das terras que capturarem.$0f
Não falhe comigo.$0f
Nunca, meu senhor.$0f

Ei! $0ePor que não destruímos as#linhas de Orange Star?$0f
Eles...$0e Eles são mais fortes#do que pensávamos...$0f
Não quero desculpas!$0e$0e#Quero a vitória!$0f
Mais problemas, senhor!$0fFomos informados da chegada de#uma nova CO de Orange Star...$0f
.........$0f
Senhor Flak, $0ese continuarmos assim,#conseguiremos apenas mais baixas.$0f
Não há mais nada a fazer.$0e$0e#Use as tropas que nos restam.$0fEnquanto o CO de Orange Star...$0e#Como é?$0f
Ufa! $0eMuito bem, já cuidamos da#maioria das forças de Black Hole.$0fEsse exército de Black Hole está#demonstrando ser muito perigoso.$0f
Comandante! $0eLocalizamos o resto#das unidades inimigas.$0fEstamos prontos para iniciar a#perseguição.$0f
Entendido. $0e$0eEu cuido disso daqui#em diante!$0f
Nell!$0e$0e Qual é o problema!?#Você está bem?$0f
Oh, $0eAndy!$0e$0e Desculpa por#chamá-lo com tanta urgência.$0f
Onde estão os malvados?$0f
Acalme-se.$0e$0e$0fEu já me encarreguei da#maioria dos inimigos.$0f
Oh...$0e$0e Eu esperada ter a chance#de dar um show para você.$0f
Não seja tonto, Andy! $0e$0eIsso não é#um exercício de treinamento!$0fVocê pode ser um gênio da mecânica,#mas ainda precisa praticar com os$0fsoldados.$0fNão acredito que você esteja#preparado para o combate quanto$0fvocê pensa que está.$0fDeixo você tomar controle no meu#lugar, mas ficarei dando instruções$0fa medida que avançarmos.#Quero você prestando atenção!$0f
Sim, senhora!$0e$0e#Vamos começar!$0f
As unidades laranja estão sob#o seu comando.$0fSeus inimigos são essas unidades#pretas na parte superior direita$0fdo mapa.$0f
Seu objetivo é simples: recuperar#nossos territórios.$0fPara isso, capture o QG do inimigo ou#derrote todas as unidades inimigas.$0fAdiante e tome cuidado para que#o inimigo não derrote suas tropas.$0f
Tudo bem! $0e$0eEstou pronto!$0f
Sair correndo para o campo de#batalha para receber uma cacetada$0e$0fnão é o meu estilo.$0fVamos revisar algumas instruções#básicas de remanejamento de tropas.$0f
Primeiro, $0euse este cursor para dar#as ordens.$0fMova-o com o Controle#Direcional +.$0e$0e$0fVamos, tente dar ordens para uma#unidade.$0fColoque o curso sobre a unidade e#aperte o Botão A.$0f
Você escolheu Fim.$0e$0fIsso encerrará o seu turno e o inimigo#iniciará os seus movimentos.$0fSó escolha esta opção depois que#terminar de dar as ordens a todas$0fas suas unidades.$0fAgora tente dar ordens à uma#unidade.$0f
Isso é uma unidade de infantaria.$0fSua potencia de disparo é limitado,#$0emas são essenciais para o combate.$0fAgora, $0evocê lembra qual é o#objetivo deste mapa?$0f
Claro! $0eDesfazer-se de todos os#malvados ou capturar o seu QG!$0f
Você lembrou! $0eMuito bem!$0fAgora, $0e$0eisso é importante: $0e$0esomente os#soldados terrestres podem capturar$0fpropriedades.$0fMas claro, a infantaria é um tipo de#soldado terrestre.$0f
Certo!$0fSe eu não tiver soldados terrestres,$0e#não poderei capturar nada.$0f
Isso mesmo! Agora, não se esqueça:#você poderá capturar apenas$0fpropriedades inimigas e neutras.$0fO comando Capturar aparecerá#quando você colocar uma unidade$0fde infantaria sobre uma das#propriedades mencionadas.$0f
Muito bem, $0evamos mover uma#unidade.$0fVocê notou que alguns dos espaços que#rodeiam a unidade mudam de cor?$0fIsso é o alcance de movimento da#unidade.$0fAssim que terminar de mover#uma unidade,$0faparecerá o menu de Comandos.$0fEscolha Esperar se você não tiver#mais nenhuma ordem para essa$0funidade.$0f
Essa é uma unidade APC.$0e$0fOs APCs não possuem capacidade#ofensiva.$0f
Oh, que fraco!$0f
Eles são fracos em combate,#mas são incrivelmente úteis.$0fPodem carregar unidades de#infantaria $0ee fornecer suprimentos$0fàs suas unidades.$0f
Carregar, hã?$0e$0fNão entendi muito bem, mas#parece ser útil.$0f
Se você colocar uma unidade#de infantaria em um APC,$0e$0fo comando Carregar aparecerá.#Então use o comando Descarregar$0fpara descarregar essa unidade.$0fEssa unidade é útil para transportar#infantaria rapidamente a algum$0flugar concreto.$0f
Entendi... $0eAs unidades de infantaria#podem avançar 3 espaços,$0e$0fmas os APCs podem avançar#6 espaços.$0fTenho que testar isso!$0f
Tenha cuidado: $0eas unidades que#acabarem de descargar poderão$0fapenas Esperar.$0fPortanto, $0evocê só poderá#descarregar unidades nos terremos$0fque normalmente eles podem ocupar.$0f
Se eu soltar a infantaria no mar,$0e#eles irão se afogar, certo?$0e$0fTudo bem. Vou me lembrar#disso.$0fA propósito, Nell, o que significa#"Suprimento"?$0f
Units lose both fuel and primary-#weapon ammo as they fight.$0fWhen they run out of primary-weapon#ammo, your units use weaker attacks.$0fWhen they run out of gas, your#units can't move.$0fAPCs can supply fuel and rounds to#units in adjacent spaces.$0fAPCs automatically supply any nearby#units at the start of each turn.$0fHowever, you can use the Supply#command if you need supplies quickly.$0f
 in a hurry!$0f
APCs can move 6!$0fI've gotta give that a try!$0f
All right, now take a close look at#movement range.$0fDo you see how the APC can't travel#in the mountains?$0fAll units have a movement type, $0eand#this affects their movement costs.$0fAPCs move on treads, like tanks, $0e$0eso#they can't cross mountains or rivers.$0fTo see intel on units, $0eselect them and#press the R Button.$0f
How do I check which units can move#in specific types of terrain?$0f
Place the cursor on the terrain, $0eand#press the R Button for intel!$0f
When you've finished deploying all of#your units,$0e your turn's finished.$0fPlace the cursor in an empty space#and press the A Button.$0fOn the Command menu, $0eselect End to#complete your turn.$0f
That woman's tough...$0e$0e#Can I win with these units?$0fHah! $0eThis is where the fun starts.$0f
Hey, $0eNell.$0e We're fighting#the Black Hole Army, right?$0f
Yes. $0e$0eHowever, it isn't Sturm we're#facing. It looks like another CO.$0fI get the impression that whoever it is#just wants to smash things.$0f
Well, he's not getting away with#anything while I'm around!$0f
That's the spirit! $0eI knew I could count#on you!$0f
Now,$0e let me give you some instructions#on combat.$0fThe infantry under your command#here $0eare direct-combat units.$0f
Direct combat is when I move next to#an enemy unit and attack, right?$0f
That's right!$0e$0e You're such a quick#study!$0fAfter you attack, $0ethe enemy will#always counterattack if possible.$0fDamaged units lose firepower, though...$0fso even if the enemy fires back,$0e it's#to your advantage to attack first.$0f
Ok, $0eso my attack reduces the enemy's#HP $0eand its attack strength.$0fThat means I take less damage! $0e$0eHe#who strikes first $0ewins!$0f
Damaged units will have an icon#on them displaying their remaining HP.$0fIf their HP reaches 0, $0ethey'll vanish#from the battle, $0eso be careful!$0fMove next to an opponent, $0eand Fire#will appear in the Command menu.$0fSelect Fire, $0econfirm your target,$0e#and the combat will begin. $0eSimple!$0f
Sure is! $0eI'm itching to get started!$0f
You see the window on the left, right?$0e$0e#That's called the Cursor Intel window.$0fThe heart icon shows HP. $0eThe fuel#tank shows remaining gas.$0fIf the unit has a primary weapon,$0e#the number of rounds left is shown.$0fAs a CO, $0eit's your duty to be#aware of your units' conditions.$0f
Your infantry unit has begun capturing.$0e#Look at the Cursor Intel window, please.$0f
The number that went down here is the#Capture Number.$0f When it reaches 0,$0fthe property is captured!$0fAn infantry unit with 10 HP reduces#the Capture number by 10 in 1 turn.$0fSo, $0ean undamaged infantry unit can#capture a property in 2 turns.$0fIf the capturing unit is moved or#defeated before the property is$0fsecured, $0ethe Capture Number returns#to its maximum, $0eso be careful!$0f
I understand! $0eGotta protect units#that are capturing!$0f
Correct!$0fDon't forget, $0euntil the property has#been fully secured, you need to order$0fyour units to Capture each turn.$0f
The Orange Star Army is here!$0e#I order you to surrender!$0f
You did it, Andy!$0e$0e#This area has been liberated!$0f
Hmmm...$0e#But$0e it was kinda too easy...$0f
Don't worry. $0e$0eI've a feeling that we're#in for a whole slew of combat.$0fToday, $0ehowever,$0e we celebrate#your victory! $0e$0eKeep up the good work!$0f
Andy! $0eWhat in the world?$0e$0e#Your units are out of fuel!!!$0f
I,$0e um...$0eI though I saw#something, and...$0f
Don't lie to me, young man!$0e$0e You were#playing around, wasting time and fuel!$0fI am VERY disappointed!$0fOpen up the Map menu $0e and select#Options, please!$0fNow choose Yield, $0e and we can#try this over from the beginning.$0f
Ok... $0eI won't mess up again.$0f
Too bad, $0ebut you've been defeated.$0fI think your superior numbers made#you overconfident.$0fRecklessly charging about means#the enemy can get the jump on you.$0fTry moving just outside the foe's#movement range and waiting there.$0fThat way, $0ethe enemy comes to you,#and you can fire first.$0fBetter luck next time!$0f
That's just a taste#of my skill!
Commander, $0eenemy troops have been#spotted on the far side of the river.$0f
Are you sure?!?$0e$0e#Here? In this rural area?$0f
What are your orders, ma'am?$0e$0e#Should we cease ops and attack?$0f
That's affirmative, soldier.$0fWe can't allow the enemy a foothold#this deep in Orange Star territory.$0f
Good assessment, Sami!$0fThat's the tactical sense I expect#from a special-forces commander!$0f
Nell!$0e$0e#What are you doing here?$0f
Tracking down the CO who's#invading Orange Star, of course!$0fSami, $0ecan I trust you to take#care of this situation?$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0fBut if you had some advice you could#offer,$0e I'd feel much more confident.$0f
I'd be happy to, Sami!$0e$0e#Ok, troops! $0eLet's move out!$0f
Lord Flak, $0eour infantry has reported#finding Orange Star properties.$0f
What?$0e$0e Enemy cities?$0e$0e#Capturing bases is grunt work,$0fbut I was told we need cash to#fund the invasion...$0fListen up! $0eIf it ain't nailed#down,$0e steal it!$0fNow, $0ecities, bases, or whatever,$0e#they all got Capture Numbers of 20.$0fAny infantry with an HP of 10 can#reduce the Capture Number by 10.$0fSo, that means you can secure a#property in...$0euh...$0e2 days!$0fIf you move $0eor get taken out while#capturing, $0eyou gotta start over again!$0fYou got that? $0eWell then, get moving!$0e#Black Hole needs cash!!!$0f
Lord Flak! $0e$0eOrange Star forces#sighted on the opposite shore...$0f
What?!?$0e Is that all they got?!#$0eHah! $0eSend out the tanks!$0fTanks are powerful, and they move far.$0e$0e#Tanks are the best!$0fOrange Star COs? $0eHAH! $0eI will#crush them! $0eCrush them all!$0f
Sami, $0eyou already know the basics of#troop deployment, $0e$0eso...$0fPlease look at the Cursor Intel#window below.$0f
There are some stars below the HQ#icon, right?$0fThose illustrate the level of defensive#cover offered by this terrain.$0fThe higher the defensive cover,$0e#the less damage you take in combat.$0fSo$0e try choosing terrain that#allows you to mitigate battle damage.$0fIf you need terrain intel, just press#the R Button.$0f
So that means that it's better to#engage those tanks from the woods$0frather than on the plains or roads,#right?$0f
You've got it!$0e#Go get 'em, Sami!$0f
Things will only get worse if#you select End now.$0fPlease give orders to all your#units.$0f
I'm always amazed at your ability#to capture properties, Sami!$0fThat extra speed is a useful#CO Power to have in combat.$0f
Thanks! $0e$0eBeing good at capturing and#troop transport is fine...$0fbut I'm not very comfortable attacking#with non-infantry units.$0fI guess that's something I'll#have to work on.$0f
Yes, $0ethat is important.$0fHowever, $0eit's vital that you utilize#your unique talents and develop$0fyour own fighting style, too.$0f
My...$0e My own fighting style?$0fYou're right! $0eI'll do my best, ma'am!$0f
That's the spirit! $0eI'm counting on you!$0e#Let's get back to my explanation.$0fI'd like to discuss that city#you've started capturing.$0f
Unlike the enemy HQ, $0ecapturing#this property won't win you the battle.$0fHowever, $0eall bases are vital to#the success of any campaign.$0fCan you tell me why?$0f
Um...$0ebecause they provide defensive#cover as well as funds...right?$0f
Absolutely right! $0eNicely done, Sami!$0fYour army receives funding daily#from all allied properties.$0fIf you have deployment properties,$0e#use your funds to ready new troops.$0fAs you have no deployment properties,$0e#your funds will only go toward$0frepairing your units. $0eStill, having lots#of properties is never a bad thing,$0fso capture as many as you can!$0f
The unit you've selected is an#artillery unit.$0fIt's an indirect-combat unit that can#fire on enemies from a distance.$0fAttacking from a distance means you#have no fear of counterstrikes.$0fHowever, $0eindirect-combat units cannot#fire on adjacent units.$0fThat means that indirect-combat#units cannot counterattack.$0f
Ok! $0eI'll try not to expose#them to direct fire!$0f
If you're able to do that, $0eI'm sure#they'll treat you right!$0fOne more thing, $0eindirect-combat units#cannot fire after moving.$0fThey can only attack from their#current locations.$0f
Understood! $0e$0eI'll use these units#to lie in wait and ambush the foe.$0f
Perfect!$0e Now,$0e do you remember how#to check a unit's range of fire?$0fPlace the cursor on a unit $0eand press#the B Button. $0eSee the lights?$0fArtillery units have a range of#fire of 2-3 spaces.$0fYou can confirm this intel by selecting#the unit and pressing the R Button.$0f#
That's a mech unit.$0e Mech units are#stronger than infantry units.$0fAs foot soldiers, $0ethey can capture,#use transports, $0eand cross mountains.$0fAnd, as it says under CO on the Map#menu, $0eyou're tops with infantry.$0fInfantry under your command have#superior firepower.$0fThis allows them to hold their own#even against tank units.$0fBe careful not to let the enemy#fire on you first, though.$0f
Ouch! $0eThat unit's been hurt.$0e#I need someplace to rest it.$0f
Don't panic, Sami.$0e$0e#There's a way to help that unit out.$0fUnits that have taken damage can#rest on any allied property.$0fWhile they're resting, $0ethey recover#2 HP at the start of each turn.$0fPlus, $0eresting units also replenish#all of their fuel and ammo!$0f
Bases also have the advantage of#high terrain cover! $0eSpectacular!$0f
You're right!$0fHowever, $0eenemies receive the same#benefits from their bases.$0fSo, $0ecapturing properties is vital in#any successful combat plan!$0f
Understood!$0e#Capturing is something I excel at!$0f
Grrrr!$0e#Two women COs!$0fGood country!$0e$0e#I must have it!$0f
It's our turn.$0fMove any damaged units onto secure#properties and rest them.$0fBe sure to continue capturing any#bases that are not yet secure.$0f
Now,$0e maybe this is something#you've been wondering about...$0f
There are some numbers displayed#next to your picture, right?$0fThose numbers are your current#funds. $0e$0eYou have 6,000 G.$0fFunds are used to deploy new troops,$0e#but don't worry about that now.$0fDepending on the unit's cost,$0e some#funds might be needed for repairs.$0fThat's it for my lessons today.$0e$0e#Can I leave the rest up to you?$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0e#I feel confident of victory!$0f
Grrrr!$0e#Not bad...$0efor a girl!$0f
You're the Black Hole CO!?$0e You're#just a thug! $0eWho do you think--$0f
Yap, yap, yap! $0eShut your trap!$0fI'm leaving $0efor now...$0e$0e#Next time, $0eI'll put you in your place.$0f
Hey!$0f
He escaped...$0e$0e#And he was so rude, too!$0f
Oooh!!$0e$0e#That makes me so angry!$0fIf I get the chance, I'm gonna#run him down!$0f
I'm glad we can depend on you, Sami.$0f
How disappointing.$0e#You've been defeated.$0fProtect the cities to the left of the#bridge with mech or infantry, and$0fhalt the foe's advance.$0fDeploy indirect-combat units behind#you to lay down covering fire.$0fUse the cities below to rest#your troops and let them recover.$0fDon't forget, your infantry can#cross rivers! That's important.$0f
Understood... $0eMy apologies, ma'am.$0f
Sami, $0eI know you won't make the same#mistake twice. $0eYou'll win next time!$0f
That big thug! He won't#get away next time!
Hey!$0e Orange Star dogs!$0e$0e#Can you hear me?$0f
Um... Lord Flak...$0e#The microphone?$0f
Shut up!$0e$0e#Too complicated!$0fAnyone there?$0e$0e#Or are you too scared to face me?!?$0f
What's with the racket?$0e$0e#You lonely or something?$0f
Hah! $0eLook! A gorilla!$0f
What did you say?!?$0fIf anyone here's a gorilla,$0e#it's you, ape-man!$0f
I'm no ape!$0e$0e#I'm Flak!!!$0f
Flak? $0e$0eWhat's that,#some sort of code name?$0fListen up, Flak.$0e#My name's Max.$0fNow tell me what you jerks are doin'#rampaging through our country?$0f
YOUR country?$0fOrange Star belongs to the Black#Hole Army now!$0fYou complain, you get hurt!$0f
Oh, you think so!?$0e$0e#Give it your best shot!$0f
Max! $0eCalm down.$0f
Nell?!?$0f
To lose your head is to lose the fight.$0e$0e#I taught you that, remember?$0f
Yes, $0ebut...I...$0e$0e#It's just...$0f
I understand your anger, Max.$0e No one#likes seeing his homeland ravaged.$0fAll the more reason to proceed calmly#and rationally.$0fUse your head, $0eand drive these#fiends from our borders! $0eOk?$0f
You got it! $0eLet's roll!$0f
Now, Max, $0eI know that you're a#combat veteran, but...$0f
medium tanks,$0f
battle copters,$0f
and transport copters$0f
are tough to handle if you're a#bit rusty.$0f
You deployed copters?!?$0fWell, it has been a while since I've#dealt with air units.$0fBut Md tanks?!? $0eC'mon, it's a tank!$0e#Bigger and stronger, but still a tank!$0f
Ok, $0eI'll give you that one.$0fIn the knock-down-drag-out world of#direct combat, $0eyou're the champ.$0fWhen it comes to firing, $0eair units act#the same as ground units.$0fI'll bet that your tank expertise#makes you handy with B copters, too!$0f
Ha ha...yeah. $0eYou're probably right.$0fIn a head-to-head battle, I can't#be beaten!$0f
However, indirect combat is another#story, isn't it?$0f
......$0f
I'll admit that your power has over-#come that particular obstacle, though.$0f
You know it! $0eIndirect-combat units?$0e#Who needs 'em?!$0f
I can't fault your confidence.$0e#Try not to overdo it!$0f
You should never end your turn until#you've issued orders to all your units.$0fHe who hesitates is lost!$0e$0e#Never waste a day if you can help it.$0f
That's a transport copter, right?$0fLike APCs, T copters can carry#infantry and mech units.$0fAnother similarity is that they lack#weapons. $0eT copters cannot fire.$0fOn a map like this, $0ewhere you need to#circle around to reach the enemy HQ,$0fT copters can shorten the distance.$0e#Even seas are no obstacle.$0f
Now that's useful!$0f
Yes, it is! $0eI'll leave it to you on#how best to utilize them.$0fLoading and unloading with T copters#is handled the same as with APCs.$0fNot being able to drop units off in#certain terrain is the same, too.$0fOne other thing: $0eT copters can't#load or unload troops when flying$0fover seas. $0eDon't forget that.$0f
What you have there is a battle#copter. $0e$0eIt's a direct-combat unit.$0fAir units are easy to deploy because#their movement isn't limited by terrain.$0fOf course, they don't receive any#defensive cover, either.$0fB copter firepower is at least equal#to a tank's...$0fand in dogfights with other copters,#they're as tough as can be.$0fPress the R Button for further intel.$0f
All right!$0e#I'm gonna knock some heads!$0f
We talked about this earlier, right?$0e#Your difficulty with indirect combat?$0f
Oh...yeah...$0e$0e#I thought we'd covered that.$0f
Just hear me out, Max.$0fTo see your units' ranges of fire,#press the B Button.$0fIn your case, the ranges are a little#small, so make sure you take a look.$0f
Yeah, I know... You don't have#to keep reminding me about it.$0fBut yeah, I'll admit it:$0e knowing your#weak points is important.$0f
Wow! $0e$0eMax, $0eyou've come a long way.$0e#I didn't think I'd hear you say that.$0f
Oh,$0e well...$0e Hey! $0eIt's about time to#show these goons we mean business!$0f
NO! $0eThose copters are damaged!$0e#Where can I repair them?$0f
Sorry, Max, $0ebut there's no place to#repair air units on this map.$0fYou need an airport for that, $0eand#there's just not one around here.$0fYou're not completely helpless, though.$0e#There's another B copter unit, right?$0fWell, you can take two units of the#same type and join them together.$0fDo this to create one unit that has#the combined HP of the single units.$0f
Join?!?$0e Making one unit out of two?$0f
Uh-huh. $0eTwo become one, $0eand they#combine their HP.$0fOf course, this does mean that you#have one less unit to work with.$0fMy advice is to avoid this unless#it's absolutely necessary.$0f
Can an individual unit have more#than 10 HP?$0f
Unfortunately, no. $0e10 is the max.$0fTo join, simply move one unit onto the#other and select the Join command.$0fOne more thing: $0ea damaged unit#cannot join with an undamaged unit.$0f
Ok! $0eI got it!$0f
You know, this Max guy kinda reminds#me of me...$0eexcept...$0e$0e$0eI'm me.$0fHmmm...$0e This should be fun.$0f
How's that, ape-man?!?$0e$0e#Told you not to mess with me!$0f
...$0eHah!$0f
Hah? $0eDon't hah me!$0e$0e#You just got beaten!$0f
This was just a test.$0e$0e#Next time is for real.$0f
Like I've never heard that before!$0fI'm gonna make you regret ever#showing your ugly mug around here!$0f
Max, or whatever you said your#name was, $0eyou're mine!$0fBefore this is over, $0eI'll crush#you like a bug. $0e$0eSo long.$0f
Wait! $0eWait, you dirtbag!$0e$0e#Shoot! $0eHe got away!$0f
Black Hole...$0e#Deplorable characters. $0eAll of them.$0f
You said it!$0f
By the way, $0ethere's something else I#wanted to talk to you about.$0fAfter the battle, you'll see some#points and a rank displayed, right?$0fThe points you can use in Battle Maps#to buy things from Hachi.$0fI'll explain how to get high points.$0f
Ok! $0eI definitely want to win with#the highest ranking possible.$0f
I thought as much!$0fYou know, battling for higher rankings#is fun when you've got free time.$0fFirst, $0elet me tell you what the#scores all mean...$0fSpeed is the length of time#you take to complete the mission.$0fNext, $0ePower is the number of enemy#units you destroy.$0fFinally, $0eTechnique counts the#number of units you lost.$0fHowever, $0evictory is your top priority.$0e$0e#Doing silly things to earn more points$0fis not acceptable!$0f 
Points or no points, $0eI'm always at full#throttle! $0eI won't stop!$0f
NO! $0eI lost...$0e$0e#I'm sorry, everyone...$0f
Cheer up, Max. $0e$0eYou'll just have to do#better next time.$0fThose Md tanks were the problem,#weren't they?$0fIn Md tank vs. Md tank battles,$0e#everyone takes damage.$0fPlacing an Md tank unit on the bridge#to the isle might be a way to halt$0fthe enemy's advance, though.$0fUsing B copters might work, too.$0e$0e#Md tanks aren't great vs. copters.$0fThat's because they use their weak#secondary weapons against air units.$0fKnowing the strengths and weaknesses#of units is vital to your success.$0fOh, yes, $0ethe enemy HQ is unguarded,#right? $0eTime for a T copter!$0fDrop off some infantry to capture it,#and the battle is yours!$0f
What a disgrace...$0e#I won't lose again! $0eI promise, Nell!$0f
That's the spirit, Max!$0e#Good luck!$0f
Flak, huh? Dumb name,#tough CO.
Lord Flak,$0e#troop deployment is complete.$0f
Look what we have here.$0fMax's boys...$0e$0e#I'm gonna enjoy this.$0f
Uh, sir...$0e The unauthorized use of#troops for personal vendettas is...$0f
Is what, worm?$0e$0e I'm not gonna let#Max get away with what he did.$0fAs long as I win, $0ewho cares about#rules?$0e Now get outta here!$0f
Understood...$0f
Max!$0e#It's an attack!$0f
What?$0fBattle copters? $0eBombers?$0e#Coming with an air assault, huh?$0f
This doesn't look good.$0fMy troops are still recovering, and#I don't think they're ready...$0fInfantry vs. planes isn't the best#matchup to begin with.$0f
Leave it to me!$0e#I'll bring those birds down!$0f
I'll come with you.$0e#I can at least offer some advice.$0fTogether, we can get through this.$0f
All right!$0f
They have bombers...$0f
There are fighters, too.$0e$0e#Ok, $0elet's just stay calm.$0f
These are A-airs: anti-air units.$0fAs the name implies, they're strong#against air units.$0fAs direct-combat units, they're no#slouches vs. infantry, either. $0f
Oh, yeah! $0eI love direct combat!$0f
Now these $0eare missiles.$0e They're an#indirect-combat weapon.$0fThey can only fire on air units, but#the damage they cause is horrific!$0fFor more intel, select the unit and#press the R Button.$0f
Yeah,$0e and to see the range of fire,#press the B Button, right?$0f
Uh-huh! $0eI was a bit worried, but it#looks like it's all coming back to you.$0f
Don't worry$3b I'll get you home without#a scratch!$0fNow it's time to light up the skies!$0e#But just remember, you owe me one!$0f
The unit you've selected is a rocket#unit.$0fIt's an indirect-combat unit with a#fairly wide range of fire: 3-5 spaces.$0fFor you, though, Max, $0eits range of#fire drops to 3-4 spaces.$0f
Yeah, $0eI just can't seem to get the#hang of indirect combat.$0f
Don't worry too much, Max.$0e You ARE#the king of direct combat, after all.$0fOh yes, $0erockets run out of ammo#quickly...$0fso make sure you deploy them in areas#that are easy to get supplies to.$0f
Battle copters! $0eLet's move!$0f
Listen up!$0e B copters are direct-#combat units...$0fbut they can't fire on fighters#or bombers.$0fIn a copter dogfight, the attacker#wins!$0e Now go make some noise!$0f
Sir! $0eYes, sir!$0f
Max!$0e#Are you Ok?$0f
Yeah! $0eI'm fine!$0f
Be careful out there!$0fBy the way, a few of the gray stars#in the window displaying your funds$0fhave changed color, right?$0fThat's your CO Power Meter.$0fWhen the stars are flashing,#your CO Power is ready for use.$0fTo see intel on CO Powers,$0e#select CO from the Map menu.$0f
Lord Flak,$0e we've just been told that#we're not authorized to use either$0fbombers or fighters!$0f
Grrr... $0eWho needs authorization?!$0e#They were just sitting there!$0f
Lord Flak, $0ewe don't have many#soldiers trained to use them...$0f
Trained? $0e$0e#I'll train 'em myself!$0f
These bombers...$0e#They're $0edirect-combat units.$0fThey're good against ground units.$0e$0e#They're even good on Md tanks.$0fBut $0ethey can't fire on other air#units.$0e They're bombers. They bomb.$0f
This here's a fighter.$0fIt can attack other air units.$0fIt's the best weapon to have when#you're stompin' flying stuff.$0f
You have to watch fuel with air units.$0e#They burn 2 units of fuel per day.$0fGround units stop moving when they#run out of fuel, but that's all.$0fAn air unit without fuel $0efalls#out of the sky and crashes.$0fYou got it? $0eThen attack!$0e The more#you take out, the better.$0f
Yes, sir! $0eDelta squad is away!$0f
Commander!$0e We recovered this in#a city we captured!$0f
Huh? $0eWhat's this supposed to be?$0f
Ah! $0eThat... That's a map to the#enemy lab!$0f
They left a map?$0f
Actually, my troops have been#ordered to find the lab on this map!$0fIt seems that Black Hole has these#labs scattered here and there.$0fReports are that they're research#centers for new weapon development.$0f
Here and there?$0fSo there are labs like this in#Yellow Comet and Blue Moon?$0f
We're not completely sure. They're...$0e#hidden and all.$0fWhich is why we need maps like this#to help us search them out.$0fI'll warn our allies $0eand get this#intel to Nell.$0fAt the very least, we've pinned down#the lab here in Orange Star.$0fAfter we're through here, we should#be able to proceed to the lab via$0fthe Map Select screen.$0f
Max! $0eYour CO Power Meter is full!$0f
Hm? $0eIt doesn't look full to me...$0f
Your Power Meter has two levels: a#normal CO Power level, and a Super$0fCO Power level.$0e You have enough#energy for a normal CO Power.$0fYou can use it now $0eor wait and#save up for a Super CO Power.$0fHow you use your CO Powers is#completely up to you.$0fThe well-timed use of a CO Power#can alter the course of a battle.$0fTo use a CO Power, select Power#from the Map menu.$0f
All right!$0fTime to show 'em who's boss!$0f
Yes!!!$0e#Here is Flak's power!$0f
All right! $0eHow's that, Sami?#$0eNot a scratch anywhere!$0f
Thanks, Max!$0e#But what about your troops?$0f
Hah! $0eThis is nothing. My troops#eat this stuff for breakfast!$0f
Grrr...$0e Blast!$0f
Yo, Flak!$0e#You had enough?$0f
......$0f
Just give it up, already.$0f
Don't start mouthin' off 'cause#you won here today.$0f
What?!$0f
No one can stop the Black Hole#invasion.$0fYou'll see. $0eOne day, you and your#girlfriend'll be begging for mercy!$0fI'll retreat for now,$0e but we'll#meet again. $0eSo long.$0f
Girlfriend!? Who does he think he is?$0fBlack Hole goons...$0e Not an ounce#of decency in any of them.$0f
Yeah, $0ebut they're never gonna take#Orange Star. $0eNot while we're here.$0f
Sami! $0eMax!$0e#Are you all right?$0fHm?$0e The battle...$0e It's...#finished?$0f
Hey there, Nell! $0eYou're just in#time to join the celebration!$0f
Commander!$0e We recovered this in one#of the cities Black Hole had occupied!$0f
What now? $0eI was getting ready to go#after that dumb ape!$0e ...What is this?$0f
Ah! $0eThat... That's a map to the#enemy lab!$0f
They left a map?$0f
Actually, my troops have been#ordered to find the lab on this map!$0fIt seems that Black Hole has these#labs scattered here and there.$0fReports are that they're research#centers for new weapon development.$0f
Here and there?$0fSo there are labs like this in#Yellow Comet and Blue Moon?$0f
We're not completely sure. They're...$0e#hidden and all.$0fWhich is why we need maps like this#to help us search them out.$0fI'll warn our allies $0eand get this#intel to Nell.$0fAt the very least, we've pinned down#the lab here in Orange Star.$0fOnce we're through here, we should#be able to proceed to the lab.$0fI'll mark it on your Map Select#screen$3b just select it there.$0f
I guess you two didn't really need#my help at all here today!$0f
Rats!$0e Where did those guys#get that kind of power?!$0f
Too bad, Max. $0eMy troops weren't able#to do a thing, either.$0fWe did gain some good strategic intel,#though.$0fTo combat those air units, $0ewe need to#keep our ground units fairly close.$0fIf we keep an eye on distances, $0ewe#can draw those planes in and take$0f'em out with our anti-air units.$0fI think we can ignore the ground#units at the top of the map until$0fthey move closer to us.$0fThe air units are definitely our#first priority!$0fYour skill with those A-airs should#secure victory for us, Max!$0f
I think you're right.$0e$0e#There's no way I'll lose again!$0f
That's the spirit!$0e#Let's do it!$0f
As long as I'm here,#Orange Star is safe!
According to our intel, $0eit's just a#little farther ahead...$0f
Sami, $0ehow sure are you about this#information's accuracy?$0fIt seems odd that Flak would be#out here resting his troops.$0f
I know, $0ebut do you really think Flak's#capable of setting a trap?$0f
Well, $0esince you put it that way...$0f
You're right! Flak didn't set a#trap for you... I did!$0fFlak doesn't have a cunning bone#in his body!$0f
Who's that? $0eA little girl?$0f
A Black Hole CO perhaps?$0f
Tee hee hee! $0eYou got it!$0e#My name's Lash!$0e Nice to meet you!$0fWould you like to play with me?$0e#What do you say, grandma?$0f
I do believe I'm being taunted.$0fSami? $0eBring her to me...$0ealive.$0f
Uh...Ok.$0f
Look at this terrain...$0e I think we'll#need some naval units here.$0f
See that base up there?$0fThere's nothing we can do to keep#it from the enemy.$0fBut if we ignore it, $0ethey'll use it to#deploy ground unit after ground unit.$0f
Which means...$0ethere's only one way#for us to proceed.$0fWe have to get to that isle and#capture the enemy HQ!$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0fIf victory relies on capturing, $0ethen#I'm the right CO for the job!$0f
As well you should be!$0e You're quite#skilled at securing properties.$0fPlus, your transport units possess#superior movement range.$0f
That goes for T copters $0eand this#lander as well!$0fI'm sure you'll be able to handle#all transports with ease.$0f
First, $0elet's try and get that#T copter out of trouble!$0f
Are you planning on leaving that#T copter where it is?$0fTake responsibility and give it#some direction!$0f
You've selected a rocket, $0ewhich#is an indirect-combat unit.$0fAt 3-5 spaces, its range of fire#is fairly large.$0f
Should I think of it as a more#powerful artillery unit?$0f
Sure, $0ethat's an easy way to keep#things straight.$0fRockets run out of ammo quickly, $0eso#it's a good idea to deploy them on$0fsecure properties or near APCs.$0f
If we leave this T copter here,$0e those#2 A-air units will take it.$0f
If we go to sea, $0eit becomes vulnerable#to that cruiser.$0f
Both of these units can fire#directly on air units.$0fIf that T copter gets hit,$0e#it doesn't stand a chance.$0f
Now, we could rely on its movement#range and flee...$0fBut there's another way$0fto keep it safe.$0f
How?$0f
Easy! $0eCruisers can carry up to#2 B copters or T copters!$0fAs long as the cruiser's safe, $0eso are#its passengers.$0fAs luck would have it, $0eyou have a#cruiser under your command.$0fWhy don't you try it out?$0f
This is a battleship.$0e It's an indirect-#combat naval unit.$0fIt can fire on both ground and naval#units.$0fIt also has the largest range of#fire of all indirect-combat units.$0fIt should be able to reach that rocket#unit from its current location.$0fGive it a try!$0f
You've selected a sub.$0e$0e Subs are#direct-combat units.$0fSubs can fire on all naval units,$0e#including the cruiser above.$0fHowever, they're rather ineffective#vs. cruisers, $0eso don't expect too much.$0fSubs also have the ability to dive#under the surface of the sea.$0f
Dive?$0e That means they can't be#attacked while submerged, $0eright?$0f
That's half true.$0e$0e They can't be fired#upon by most units while submerged.$0fHowever, other subs and cruisers can#attack at any time.$0fAs you know, $0ewhen naval units run out#of fuel, $0ethey sink.$0fSubmerged subs use a lot more fuel.$0e In#fact, $0ethey use 5 units per day.$0fIf in danger, $0eselect Rise to surface,#and head to port...$0fWell, there are no ports here, $0eso#use an APC to refuel.$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0f
Ok, let's take a look at the cruiser#you've selected.$0fIt's a direct-combat unit, $0ebut it can#only fire on certain units.$0fIt can only attack air units and subs.$0fI believe it can reach the enemy sub#from here, $0eso go ahead and attack.$0f
What we have here is a lander.$0fIt transports troops in exactly the#same way APCs do.$0fIt's also restricted to dropping units#on terrain those units can traverse.$0fIt's unique in that it can carry 2#ground units at once.$0fOn this map, the only place it can#drop troops is on shoals.$0fIt can normally use ports as well,$0e#but since there are no ports here...$0f
Under these conditions, $0ethis lander#is a unit I just can't do without.$0f
I agree.$0e$0e You must be careful to keep#it from being fired upon.$0f
Sami! $0eAre you Ok?$0f
Yes...$0e#I think so.$0f
By the way, a few of the gray stars#in the window displaying your funds$0fhave changed color, right?$0fThat's your CO Power Meter.$0e Power#builds up slowly during combat.$0fWhen the stars are flashing, your CO$0e#Power is ready for use.$0fTo see intel on CO Powers, $0eselect#CO from the Map menu.$0f
Oh, I almost forgot.$0e$0e#I have something to tell you!$0fYou know, I didn't lead you all the way#out here for nothing.$0fOn day 7, $0eFlak's bringing his troops,$0e#and we're gonna pinch you like a bug!$0f
What?!?$0f
Yep!$0e You're running out of time!$0e$0e#Tee hee hee!$0f
Well, $0eisn't this an unpleasant surprise.$0e$0e#This Black Hole CO has a brain.$0fOk, Sami, $0eyou heard her! $0e$0eFlak and#his goons are closing in!$0fWe've got to clear this map within#7 days!$0fHere's your chance to prove your rep#for surprising the foe is deserved.$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0e#I'll give it my best shot!$0f
Day 2...$0e Let me tell you a bit#more about these naval units.$0fAt the beginning of each day,$0e naval#units burn 2 units of fuel.$0fIf their fuel supply runs out,$0e#they sink and vanish.$0fTo refuel, $0eplace naval units in ports#or move them next to APCs.$0f
Understood!$0f
Ok. $0eI'm going to leave the rest of this#battle up to you.$0fGood luck!$0f
Flak's troops arrive tomorrow.$0e$0e#I wonder if Sami's Ok.$0f
Sami!$0e#Your CO Power Meter's full!$0f
Huh? $0eIt doesn't look full to me...$0f
Your Power Meter has two levels: a#normal CO Power level$0e and a Super$0fCO Power level.$0e You have enough#energy now for a normal CO Power.$0fYou can use it now $0eor wait and#save up for a Super CO Power.$0fHow you use your CO Powers is#completely up to you.$0fThe well-timed use of a CO Power#can alter the course of a battle.$0fTo use a CO Power, select Power#from the Map menu.$0f
Understood!$0f
Tee hee hee!$0e#C'mon! $0eLet's play!$0f
Congratulations, Sami!$0e#You won!$0f
Whew...$0e#I came through somehow.$0f
Now, $0eI'd like to talk to our energetic#little friend again.$0fSami! $0eDrag her over here, please.$0f
Uh,$0e I...$0e Yes, ma'am!$0f
......$0f
Wait a minute... This isn't that brat!$0e#This...$0e This is...$0f
It's a dummy.$0f
She escaped!? Unbelievable!$0e#She played us like a pair of fools!$0fFlak's troops are closing in.$0e$0e#Let's get out of here!$0f
What a troublesome pair they turned#out to be...$0f
This...$0e#This can't be happening...$0f
The time limit on this battle made#things more difficult than normal.$0fRouting the enemy when they've got#deployment properties is tough.$0fUsing your lander and T copter to#position troops to capture the$0fenemy HQ might be your best bet.$0fT copters can only carry infantry,$0e#but they can get them over the sea.$0fIt's a bit of a long haul to use landers,#but they can carry non-infantry units.$0fYou can decide which method is best#for you. $0eJust don't panic.$0fSami, $0eI know you're capable of#pulling this off!$0f
Yes, ma'am...$0e#I won't let you down!$0f
That's the spirit!$0e#Never give up!$0f
Lash... She's going#to be a handful.
Pardon me, ma'am,$0e#Commander Andy's arrived.$0f
Thank you.$0e$0e#Send him in.$0f
Hey, Nell!$0e#How're things looking?$0f
That's what concerns me...$0e#Do you see that giant cannon?$0f
Wow! $0eIt's huge!$0e#I've never seen anything like it!$0f
A cannon that size is a first#for me, too.$0fThe Black Hole Army seems to be#much more of a threat than last time.$0f
You got that right!$0e$0e#Nell, $0elet me take care of this.$0f
Max?$0e#What are you doing here?$0f
C'mon, Nell. $0eThis job's too much#for Andy.$0fYou need someone with my strength#to take out that cannon.$0f
Hey! $0eI can do this!$0f
Knock it off, Andy.$0e$0e#War isn't a game.$0fYou'll just get hurt.$0f
Max,$0e#I have faith in Andy.$0fEven if he's not as powerful as you#are,$0e he can do things no one else can.$0fI think this will be a good experience#for him, so let's let him handle this.$0f
Hmph! $0eDon't come cryin' to me if he#gets hurt!$0fYo, Andy!$0e#You sure you're up for this?$0f
You know it!$0e$0e#Sit back and watch, Max!$0f
Flak!$0e Flakalakalakalaaaaaaak!!!$0e#The Black Cannon's ready to go!$0f
Got it. $0eThanks, Lash.$0e$0e#Now I'll smash 'em good!$0f
Don't forget, you promised to be a#guinea pig in my next experiment!$0f
Hmmm...$0e#Yeah, I remember.$0f
Well, I'm off! $0eToodles!$0e$0e#Have fun!$0fOh, yeah! $0eAlmost forgot, $0e$0eHawke said#to hurry and conquer Orange Star!$0f
Hawke said...$0fCrush. $0eI gotta crush 'em here.$0e$0e#I have to...$0ecrush 'em all...$0f
Hey!$0e What's up with this?$0e#There are hardly any units deployed!$0f
It's up to you to decide which units#you need and where to deploy them.$0f
Deploy them? $0eYou mean I have to#form units as I go along?$0f
That's exactly what I mean.$0e See#those 2 properties next to your HQ?$0f
Those are deployment properties#called bases.$0fYou can deploy ground#units from them.$0fTo deploy units, select a base$0e#and press the A Button.$0f
Now, there's a window at the top of#the screen, right?$0f
The 6,000 you see here is the#amount of funding you have.$0f
Funds increase depending on the#number of properties you control.$0fYou receive 1,000 per property each#day.$0fYou currently have your HQ,#2 bases, and 3 cities.$0fThat amounts to 6,000 in funds.$0f
I get it! $0eFunds increase on the day#after I capture a new property!$0f
That's exactly right, Andy.$0e Then you#use that money to deploy more troops.$0fSelect a base and press the A#Button to select the type of unit$0fyou want to deploy.$0e The number next#to the unit is its deployment cost.$0fRemember, $0eunits cannot move on the#day that they are deployed.$0fIn this case...$0e Yes, that should work.$0fFirst, you need to increase your#funds, $0eso deploy some infantry or$0fmech units and capture some neutral#properties.$0e Don't forget to use your$0fAPCs and T copters to transport#units to properties farther out, too.$0fAs for combat, $0eyou've got some room#to maneuver, $0eso I'd advise advancing$0fwith tanks and artillery.$0fWhen you can afford it, $0edeploy some#more powerful units, like Md tanks.$0fOnce you capture neutral bases,$0e#you can deploy troops from them.$0fOf course,$0e the enemy can do the#same, so don't dillydally!$0fI'll contact you as soon as I have#any intel on that giant cannon.$0fThis may be rough going,$0e#but do your best!$0f
Here I go!$0e Keep watching, Max!$0e#I'm gonna show you something!$0f
Contact at last.$0e$0e#Andy, $0eare you Ok?$0f
Yeah,...I think so.$0f
Well don't overdo it, all right?$0fBy the way, a few of the gray stars#in the window displaying your funds$0fhave changed color, right?$0fThat's your CO Power Meter.$0e Power#builds up slowly during combat.$0fWhen the stars are flashing, $0eyour CO#Power is ready for use.$0fTo see intel on CO Powers, $0eselect#CO from the Map menu.$0f
I see you've deployed a recon unit.$0f
You won't notice here, $0ebut recon#units have large vision ranges.$0fThey're invaluable in Fog of War.$0fThey also have extended movement#ranges and can take on infantry$0fand mech units with decent success.$0e#They're handy units to have around.$0f
Now you've deployed an A-air unit.$0fThey're strong not just against air#units, $0ebut against infantry, too.$0f
What you've chosen to deploy now#is a rocket unit.$0fIt's an indirect-combat unit with a#firing range of 3-5 spaces.$0fThat's pretty impressive.$0f
So it's like an artillery unit,$0e#only stronger.$0f
That's a good way of thinking of it.$0fRockets run out of ammo quickly, $0eso#it's a good idea to deploy them on$0fsecure properties or near APCs.$0f
Ok, $0ethat's a missile unit.$0e$0e#It's another indirect-combat unit.$0fIt can only attack air units, $0e#but it has devastating power!$0f
You've deployed a neotank!$0fYou know, we only just developed#the tech to deploy that unit!$0f
A neotank?$0e#It looks tough!$0f
Oh, yes.$0fYou'll see for yourself, $0ebut they're#even more powerful than Md tanks!$0fI'm sure you'll come to depend on them.$0fThey're direct-combat units, so just#deploy them as you would any tank.$0f
All right!$0e I'm gonna use 'em#to break stuff!$0f
So? $0eIs it ready?$0f
Hmmm... $0eThe cannon?$0e#Nope, not yet.$0fIt's going to take the rest of the day#just getting ready to fire.$0f
Grrr...$0e Is that so? $0eGuess I'll#go take charge of the battle then.$0f
Ok! $0eToodles!$0e#Tomorrow's the day! $0eTee hee!$0f
Andy!$0fI've got some intel on that#monstrosity!$0fIt's called a Black Cannon.$0fIt's supposed to have a huge range of#fire. $0eUse the B Button to check it out.$0fThat's just a prototype, though, $0eso it#can only fire once every 2 days.$0fIt's designed to fire on the strongest#unit within range.$0fI'll get back to you once I get#some intel on its weak points.$0f
Understood!$0f
Yippee!$0e#It's ready to fire!$0fBlack Cannon...$0eattack!$0e#Tee hee!$0f
Andy!$0e#You're CO Power Meter's full!$0f
Huh? $0eIt doesn't look full to me!$0f
Your Power Meter has two levels: a#normal CO Power level$0e and a Super$0fCO Power level.$0e You have enough#energy now for a normal CO Power.$0fYou can use it now $0eor wait and#save up for a Super CO Power.$0fHow you use your CO Powers is#completely up to you.$0fThe well-timed use of a CO Power#can alter the course of a battle.$0fTo use a CO Power, select Power#from the Map menu.$0f
Ok! $0eTime to show what I can do!$0f
Grrr!!$0e#Was that a CO Power?!$0fCan't believe that runt has a#CO Power!$0fListen up! $0eWe're not lettin' that squid#thump us! $0eNo way, $0eno how!$0f
Graaaaaa! $0eHere I come!!!$0e#Eat this!!!$0f
Andy, $0eI've discovered the#enemy's weak point.$0f
All right!$0e Way to go, Nell!$0f
When you attack the Black Cannon,$0e#aim here, $0efor the door.$0f
Check the cursor window to see the#unit's HP.$0fIf you can take out the Black Cannon,$0e#victory's yours!$0fThat thing surprised me at first,$0e#but it's nothing to fear now.$0fGood luck,$0e Andy!$0f
No problem! $0eI'll take care of it!$0f
Wahoo!$0e#I won! I won!$0f
Grrr!$0e$0e#Now you've done it, runt!$0f
I'm no runt!$0e#My name's Andy!$0f
Name!?$0e I didn't ask for your name!$0fArgh! $0eI can't lose any more units!$0e#I can't!$0fSound the retreat! $0e$0eHead back to#base and regroup!$0f
As long as I'm here,$0e you'll#never take Orange Star!$0f
Yo, Andy...$0e#You Ok?$0f
Max! $0eHow was I?$0e#Did you watch the whole thing?$0f
Yeah...$0eI watched.$0e$0e#That was a little close.$0f
Hey! $0eThose tanks back there...$0e$0e#Are those your troops, Max?$0f
Hm? $0eOh, um...$0ethose are...$0f
Commander Max! $0eWe received your#orders and moved out at once!$0f
Well, no one ordered you to broadcast#it to the entire world, soldier!$0f
Hmmm...$0f
What?!?$0fIt's a training exercise!$0e$0e Gotta check#those engines every now and then!$0fGeez... $0eC'mon, boys. $0eLet's go home.$0f
You know, Nell, $0eI'm really glad to have#Max on our side!$0f
So am I, Andy. $0eSo am I.$0f
It's too bad, Andy,$0e but#you were beaten this time.$0f
Ahh... $0eI can try again! $0eRight now!$0f
Calm down. $0e$0eI've got some advice for#you, $0eand I want you to listen.$0fThe Black Cannon attack does make#things difficult, but...$0fFirst, $0euse a T copter to transport a#unit out to that base on the isle.$0fWe know that base is outside the#Black Cannon's range of fire, right?$0fSo, let's capture it! $0eNow deploy an#APC and load up some infantry.$0fNext, $0etransport those soldiers to#the base near the cannon.$0fIt's bold, $0ebut it just might work!$0fGood luck, Andy. $0e$0eGet out there and#show Max what you can do!$0f
I did it!#Did you see that!?
Do you see that?$0e#It's a Black Hole lab.$0fIf this goes well, $0ewe might be able#to seize their new weapon designs.$0f
Nell! $0eWe're ready to advance!$0e$0e#But...$0eshouldn't this be Sami's mission?$0f
No can do, Andy!$0e$0e#I'm still gathering my troops.$0fMy last battle left me with a shortage#of combat-ready soldiers.$0fBut, to be honest, $0eI'd love to try#and infiltrate their base by myself.$0f
Do you honestly think that I would#approve such recklessness?$0f
It's Ok, Sami! $0e$0eHelping each#other is what we're all about!$0fMy troops are fresh and itching#to go!$0f
Let's move out, Andy.$0fWe're in Fog of War,$0e#so let's exercise caution.$0f
Fog of War...$0e That's where you#can't see very far, right?$0fIt's tough fighting in this gunk!$0f
Everything will be fine.$0e$0e It just takes#a little getting used to is all.$0fLet's get started.$0f
Lord Flak!$0e$0e#The Orange Star Army!$0f
What?$0e$0e#How did they find us here?!?$0f
I...$0eI don't know, sir.$0e$0e#Maybe a map fell into their hands?$0f
Grrrr!$0fHow long will it take to erase all#of the weapon data?$0f
10... $0eNo, we should be able to do#it if we have 7 days.$0f
Well, get started!$0e$0e#Don't let them get that intel!$0f
As I mentioned earlier, this terrain#is hidden by Fog of War.$0fIt prevents units from seeing beyond#their individual vision ranges.$0fFor example, $0ethe vision range of#infantry is 2 spaces, $0eso they can$0fsee 2 spaces from the space where#they're deployed.$0fYour own properties are lit up, $0ebut#enemy and neutral properties aren't.$0f
That's a recon unit.$0e#Its vision range is terrific!$0f
With a vision range of 5, $0erecon units#are indispensable in Fog of War.$0fThey also have extended movement#ranges and can take on infantry$0fand mech units with decent success.$0e#They're handy units to have around.$0f
I can't see into those woods!$0e#What's going on?$0f
You can't see into woods even if#they're within your vision range.$0fThe only way to tell if an enemy unit#is hiding there is to move to the$0fspace next to the woods.$0e#The same goes for the enemy, too.$0fIf you conceal a unit in the woods,$0e#it won't be spotted unless the enemy$0fgets right next to it.$0f
So, battling in Fog of War's like#a big game of hide-and-seek!$0f
You know, Andy, $0eyou're right. $0eIt is.$0fYou'll also have to watch out for#ambushes in Fog of War.$0fThese occur when you try to move to#or through a space occupied by an$0fenemy unit.$0e If this happens, you'll#stop moving,$0e and you won't be able$0fto move until the next day.$0fThere are lots of ambushes in woods,$0e#so be extra careful.$0f
Got it!$0f
You know how to win, right?$0fDestroy all the enemy units, $0eor#capture the enemy HQ.$0fThe foe looks like they're preparing#to flee, $0eso you'd better hurry!$0f
Infantry and mech units can do more#than just capture, you know.$0fThey can increase their vision range#by climbing mountains!$0fSince we have some mountains so#close by, you should test it out.$0f
Hurry up!$0e$0e#We gotta stop their advance here.$0f
Yes, sir.$0f
Andy, $0eI have some soldiers out#reconnoitering the field.$0f
According to my reports, $0ethere's an#indirect-combat unit hiding in one of$0fthe 3 woods at the top of the map.$0f 
Really?$0e#Ok, I got it!$0e I'll advance carefully.$0fThanks a bunch, Sami!$0f
How's the Fog of War?$0f
It really slows things down.$0fStrong units are useless if they#can't see anything.$0fIt's tough if you don't use#recon units well.$0f
Understanding that's half the battle!$0e#The rest comes with experience.$0fOh yes, $0ethere's something I forgot to#tell you yesterday.$0fIn addition to woods, $0ethere's#one other terrain type that$0fconceals units until you're next to it.$0f
It's reefs. $0eLike this one here.$0fIf you're looking to take out all#enemy units, $0edon't forget to look here!$0f
I have some new intel, Andy.$0fSomewhere in the woods near the lab#is another indirect-combat unit.$0fIf you suddenly come under fire,$0e#check the woods first.$0f
Understood!$0fCouldn't do this without you, Sami!$0e#I'll try and hold up my end!$0f
Lord Flak!$0e#The preparations are complete!$0fWe only need to hold off Orange#Star for the rest of the day.$0fIf we can do that, $0ewe'll be able to#destroy the new weapon plans!$0f
We gotta sacrifice this lab.$0fI don't like it,$0e but we#don't have a choice.$0f
Lord Flak... $0e$0eThe new weapons plans#have been stolen...$0f
.........$0e$0e#Assemble everyone in the factory.$0f
In the factory...$0e#Yes, sir!$0f
Blast!$0f
All right!$0e#We've shut down the enemy lab!$0f
Excellent work, in spite of the#difficult conditions.$0fWith these plans, $0ewe should be able to#develop neotanks of our own.$0fI think we'll have more intel on#them by the time you deploy them.$0fAnyway, $0econgratulations!$0e#This was a great victory.$0f
Sami's intel really helped a lot!$0f
I just wish I could've done more.$0f
The two of you really make a#great team.$0fLet's head for home and celebrate!$0f
Wahoo! $0eLet's have a BBQ!$0f
Oh, no...$0e$0e#I got beaten...$0f
Even if we had just let the enemy#be, $0ethey would've retreated.$0fSo it's hard to call this a loss#for Orange Star. $0eStill...$0fWe were so close to getting those#weapon plans.$0fI think we should rethink our strategy#and try this battle again!$0fIn Fog of War, $0ethe order of#advancement is very important.$0fIf you don't increase your vision#range, $0eeven strong units are useless.$0fThat's why it's so important to#confirm the location of enemy units$0fby using recon units and by sending#infantry into the mountains.$0fThat's what it takes to win in#Fog of War!$0fIt's tough, $0ebut I'm certain#you can do it!$0f
I can't wait to try#out a neotank!
They've come at last...$0e#I'll win it all with this factory.$0f
You look like you're having a rough#time, Flak.$0f
Huh?$0e What rock did you crawl out#from under, Adder?$0f
Heh heh heh... $0e$0eI wanted to see the#military strength of this world myself.$0f
Should you be here? $0fI thought you were supposed to be#invading Yellow Comet?$0f
Leave off, Flak. $0eYou'd do well not#to waste your energy on my affairs.$0fLook! $0eThe natives are knocking on#your doorstep...$0eand they look restless.$0f
Grrr...$0e#I won't lose.$0f
"Won't"? $0eHeh heh heh...$0fYou mustn't lose, Flak. $0eThat's#closer to the truth.$0f
.........$0f
I'm looking forward to your#performance. $0eHeh heh heh...$0f
Whoa!$0e$0e#What in the world is that?!?$0f
It seems to be some sort of an#installation.$0fWhat are they planning now?$0f
I believe they call it a factory.$0fThis is the center of all the damage#inflicted upon our forces.$0f
So there's no doubt that it's the#key to the entire Black Hole invasion!$0f
Yes, but...$0e#There's still so much we don't know.$0fI've got a spy on the inside,$0e#so I'll let you know if I hear anything.$0fIn the meanwhile, $0elet's launch some#sorties and see the enemy's response.$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0f
That unit's ready, right?$0e#Open the factory gate!$0f
Yes, sir.$0f
That's no base, $0eand yet an enemy unit#just came out of it. $0eWhat's going on?$0f
So that's it...$0e#I understand!$0f
What is it, Nell?$0e#Is everything Ok?$0f
No, it isn't, Max. $0eOur army's not the#only thing being attacked here.$0fThe enemy's been stealing weapons,#money, and other materials, too!$0fSomehow, they transport everything#here to this factory, then it all$0fgoes into that pipe and winds#up...$0esomewhere else.$0f
Black Hole goons... $0eThey're even more#dangerous than we originally thought.$0f
Don't worry! $0e$0eAs long as we're in this#together, there's no way we can lose!$0f
You're right, Andy.$0fYou've all made it this far.$0e#I know you'll emerge victorious.$0f
I've got new intel, troops.$0fI don't know what that factory's made#of, $0ebut I do know that we can't$0fdamage it with the weapons we$0e#have here.$0f
Are you serious?$0e Well then, how#are we gonna put it out of business?$0f
That's the problem at hand.$0fThat long pipe is also made of the#same impervious substance.$0fBut$0e take a look over there.$0f
It looks like two separate pieces of#pipe are connected there...$0f
Right. $0eThe two pieces appear to be#bolted together.$0f
Maybe Md tanks or bombers could#blast that seam apart...$0f
Yes, $0eand maybe by breaking the pipe,#we can halt their troop production.$0fFirst, we should gain control of that#airport in the center of the map.$0fThat should give us an advantage.$0fNext, we need to make good use of#your CO Powers...$0fJust so you know, your Power Meter#fills faster when you're attacked.$0fIt does build up for the attacker, too,$0e#so firing first is never a mistake!$0f
Ok!$0e Now that that's clear, I'm using#my CO Power as often as I can!$0f
Lord Flak, $0e$0eit appears that the foe#has discovered the pipe's weak point.$0f
Grrr...$0e$0e That section may be weak,$0e#but it's still not easy to destroy.$0fEven so, $0eif they manage to damage#the pipe and halt troop production,$0fwe're in deep trouble.$0fHit 'em now, $0ebefore they're ready!$0e#Smash 'em!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
We did it!$0fThere'll be no more units#coming from that factory!$0f
Aarrrgh!$0e$0e#Nooooooo!$0f
Give it up, Flak!$0e#You lose!$0f
My invasion of Orange Star may#have failed, but I'm not alone.$0fThere are other Black Hole COs,$0e#with more armies.$0f
What are you saying? $0eAre Yellow#Comet and Blue Moon under attack?$0f
Hah! $0eYou'll find out soon enough.$0fThey'll be coming for you next!$0e#I'm gone.$0f
Hey! $0eWe're not done with you!$0e$0e#...$0eHe got away again!$0fWe can't ignore his warning, can we?$0e#We've gotta contact the other armies.$0f
Yes. $0eYou're right.$0e#Let's ready reinforcements.$0fIn truth, though, $0eour own Orange Star#Army is in pretty ragged shape.$0fIf that battle had gone on much#longer, materials and morale might$0fhave dropped to dangerous levels.$0fI can't tell you how grateful I am#for all of your aid!$0e Nice work!$0f
It's all due to your instruction, Nell.$0f
No,$0e it was all of you.$0e You made the#decisions and performed the deeds.$0f
C'mon! $0eLet's hurry and check on#the other countries!$0f
Yeah! $0eLet's get busy and drive those#Black Hole thugs off the planet!$0f
You said it! $0fWe'll knock the stuffing out of 'em,#then head home for a victory feast!$0f
I knew the enemy wasn't going to roll#over and let us win, but still...$0fListen! $0eWe've made it this far,$0e#and I'm confident that you can win!$0fMaybe your first target should be the#airport...$0fBombers would make targeting that#pipe seam much easier.$0fTests of power are Max's forte,$0e#while Sami's the best at capturing.$0fOf course, Andy's strong overall and#has those amazing repair skills.$0fDon't forget, trying different COs#is a vital piece of strategy, too.$0fGood luck, everyone!$0f
Wahoo!#I beat the bad guys!
Whew... I wonder how#our allies are doing.#
Take that!#Orange Star is free!!!
Ei, Sami! $0eNell disse que#você queria nos ver!$0f
Ah, Andy! $0eMax!$0e$0e#Obrigado por virem tão rápido.$0fVocês não vão acreditar nisso...$0e#O exército de Black Hole voltou!$0f
Só pode estar de brincadeira!$0fEles não aprenderam a lição#da última vez?$0f
Acho que não...$0eVamos pegá-los!$0e$0e#Bem...$0e Onde eles estão?$0f
Vai com calma, Andy.$0e O inimigo#não está aqui em Cosmo Land.$0f
Hã?$0e$0e#Bem, onde eles estão?$0f
Em nosso mundo... $0eEm Wars World$0e#há vários continentes, certo?$0f
É sério? $0eContinentes?$0f
Seu cretino! $0eVocê não sabe#de nada, não é?$0f
Eeeiii... $0eNão está...$0eme chamando#de tonto, não é?$0f
Só estou dizendo que aquela gente#não sabe de nada...$0e não conhecem nada!$0f
Chega, vocês dois! $0eAgora não é#hora nem lugar para isso!$0fSegundo o Nell, Macro Land é#o foco do conflito, mas eles$0ftambém foram vistos em outros#países! $0eIncluindo Orange Star!$0f
E Blue Moon $0ee Yellow Comet?$0f
Também! $0eE Green Earth.$0fMe pergunto também se eles estão se#mobilizando para deter a Black Hole.$0f
Nossa!!!$0e$0e#Será como uma reunião em família!$0f
Andy! $0eIsso é uma guerra! $0e$0eAcha#que isso é algo para ser celebrado?$0f
Não, mas... $0ePoderemos ver todos#eles de novo, e isso me deixa feliz!$0fVenha, vamos lá!$0f
Espere, Andy. $0eAndy?$0e$0e#Ele se foi... $0eOh...$0f
Bem, teremos que ir de qualquer#forma, não é?$0fPelo menos ele tem atitude.$0fNão faz sentido ficarmos chateados#antes da batalha começar.$0f
Sabe... $0eEstá tudo tão tranquilo#ultimamente que...$0fEu sei que Nell vai querer nos dar#um cursinho de operações básicas$0fde combate.$0fMas tudo bem... $0eAfinal de contas,#todo treinamento é pouco!$0f
Oh, genial.$0e$0e Justamente o que eu#estava querendo...$0fOutra palestra chata.$0f
Comandante, $0etropas inimigas foram#avistadas na outra margem do rio.$0f
Você tem certeza?!?$0e$0e#Aqui? Nesta zona rural?$0f
Quais são as suas ordens?$0e$0e#Devemos cessar as operações e atacar?$0f
Afirmativo, soldado.$0fNão podemos permitir que o inimigo#adentre tanto no território Orange Star.$0f
Muito bem, Sami!$0fEsse é o sentido tático que espero de#um oficial das forças especiais!$0f
Nell!$0e$0e#What are you doing here?$0f
Tracking down the CO who's#invading Orange Star, of course!$0fSami, $0ecan I trust you to take#care of this situation?$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0e$0e#I won't let you down!$0f
Lord Flak! $0e$0eOrange Star forces#sighted on the opposite shore...$0f
What?!?$0e$0e#Is that all they got!? $0eHah!$0fSend out the tanks!$0e$0e#We'll crush 'em!$0f
Grrr...$0e$0e#Not bad...$0efor a girl.$0f
You're the Black Hole CO, right?$0fWho do you think you are?$0e$0e#What're you doing in--?$0f
Yap, yap, yap! $0eShut your trap!$0fI'm leaving $0efor now...$0e$0e#Next time, $0eI'll put you in your place.$0f
Hey!$0f
He's escaped...$0e$0e#And he was so rude, too!$0f
Oooh!!$0e$0e#That makes me so angry!$0fIf I get the chance, I'm gonna#run him down!$0f
I'm glad we can count on you, Sami.$0f
That big thug! He won't#get away next time!
How disappointing.$0e#You were defeated.$0fLet me give you some advice.$0e#Use the cities on the left to ambush$0fyour foes and halt their advance.$0fIt's vital to have your indirect attack#units lay down cover fire and$0fto use the cities below to rest#your troops and let them recover.$0fThis Fog of War limits your visual#range, so exercise caution when$0fdeploying.$0fDon't forget, your infantry can#cross rivers! That's important.$0f
Understood... $0eMy apologies, ma'am.$0f
Sami, $0eI know you won't make the same#mistake twice. $0eYou'll win next time!$0f
Hey!$0eOrange Star dogs!$0e$0e#Can you hear me?$0f
Um... Lord Flak...$0e#The microphone?$0f
Shut up!$0e$0e#Too complicated.$0fAnyone there?$0e$0e#Or are you too scared to face me?!?$0f
What's with the racket?$0e$0e#You lonely or something?$0f
Hah! $0eLook! A gorilla!$0f
What did you say?!?$0fIf anyone here's a gorilla,$0e#it's you, ape-man!$0f
I'm no ape!$0e$0e#I'm Flak!!!$0f
Flak? $0e$0eWhat's that?$0e#Some sort of code name?$0fListen up, Flak.$0e#My name's Max.$0fNow tell me what you jerks are doin'#rampaging through our country?$0f
YOUR country?$0fOrange Star belongs to the Black#Hole Army now!$0fYou complain, you get hurt!$0f
You think so?!?$0e$0e#Give it your best shot!$0f
Max! $0eCalm down.$0f
Nell?!?$0f
To lose your head is to lose the fight.$0e$0e#I taught you that, remember?$0f
Yes, $0ebut...I...$0e$0e#It's just...$0f
I understand your anger, Max.$0e No one#likes seeing his homeland ravaged.$0fAll the more reason to proceed calmly#and rationally.$0fUse your head, $0eand drive these#fiends from our borders! $0eOk?$0f
You got it! $0eLet's roll!$0f
How's that, ape-man?!?$0e$0e#Told you not to mess with me!$0f
...$0eHah!$0f
Hah? $0eDon't hah me!$0e$0e#You just got beaten!$0f
This was just a test.$0e$0e#Next time is for real.$0f
Like I've never heard that before!$0fI'm gonna make you regret ever#showing your ugly mug around here!$0f
Max, or whatever you said your#name was, $0eyou're mine!$0fBefore this is over, $0eI'll crush#you like a bug. $0e$0eSo long.$0f
Wait! $0eWait, you dirtbag!$0e$0e#Shoot! $0eHe got away!$0f
Flak, huh? Dumb#name, tough CO.
NO! $0eI lost...$0e$0e#I'm sorry, everyone...$0f
Cheer up, Max. $0e$0eYou'll just have to do#better next time.$0fThat laser's the problem, isn't it?#$0eYou have to control the port or$0fcity next to it and destroy it ASAP.$0fStopping the enemy around the bridge#above the laser would probably be$0freasonably sound tactics.$0fOf course, you could always use a#lander unit to ferry troops over$0fand capture the enemy HQ, too.#$0eIt IS unguarded, after all.$0f
What a disgrace...$0e#I won't lose again! $0eI promise, Nell!$0f
That's the spirit, Max!$0e#Good luck!$0f
Pardon me, ma'am,$0e#Commander Andy's arrived.$0f
Thank you.$0e$0e#Send him in.$0f
Nell,$0e#how're things looking?$0f
That's what concerns me...$0e#Do you see that giant cannon?$0f
Wow! $0eIt's huge!$0e#I've never seen anything like it!$0f
A cannon that size is a first#for me, too.$0fThe Black Hole Army... $0eIt's a bigger#threat than it was last time we fought.$0f
You got that right!$0e$0e#Nell, $0elet me take care of this.$0f
Max?$0e#What are you doing here?$0f
C'mon, Nell. $0eThis job's too much#for Andy.$0fYou need someone with my strength#to take out that cannon.$0f
Hey! $0eI can do this!$0f
Knock it off, Andy.$0e$0e#War isn't a game.$0fYou'll just get hurt.$0f
Max,$0e#I have faith in Andy.$0fHe might not be as powerful as you,$0e#but he can do things no one else can.$0fI think this will be a good experience#for him, so let's let him handle this.$0f
Hmph! $0eDon't come cryin' to me if he#gets hurt!$0fYo, Andy!$0e#You sure you're up for this?$0f
You know it!$0e$0e#Sit back and watch, Max!$0f
Flak, $0ethe Black Cannon's up and#ready to go.$0f
Got it. $0eThanks, Lash.$0e$0e#Now I'll smash 'em good!$0f
Don't forget, you promised to be a#guinea pig in my next experiment!$0f
Hmmm...$0e#Yeah, I remember.$0f
Well, I'm off! $0eToodles!$0e$0e#Have fun!$0fOh, yeah! $0eAlmost forgot, $0e$0eHawke said#to hurry and conquer Orange Star!$0f
Hawke said...$0fCrush. $0eSo I'm gonna crush 'em here.$0e$0e#No mistakes... $0eI'll crush 'em all...$0f
Commander! $0eWe discovered this in#a city we captured.$0f
Huh? $0eWhat's this?$0fIt looks like a map to a lab...$0e$0e#Is this lab hidden in some city?$0f
I do recall that Commander Sami was#discussing plans to attack a lab.$0f
Oh, $0eI did hear something about that!$0e$0e#Some new Black Hole weapon thingy...$0fAnd that there might be hints to it#hidden in our neighboring countries.$0f
That's correct. $0eShall I deploy some#infantry to follow up?$0f
No... $0eJust send her the intel!$0e$0e#Sami can take things from there.$0fIf we don't take care of business#here, we'll never live it down!$0f
Understood!$0e#We'll proceed as ordered, sir!$0f
Good! $0e$0eLet's show those creeps who#they're messing with!$0f
Wahoo!$0e$0e#I won! I won!$0f
Grrr!$0e$0e#Now you've done it, runt!$0f
I'm no runt!$0e#I'm Andy!$0f
NAME?$0e I didn't ask for your name!$0fArgh! $0eI can't lose anymore! $0eI can't!$0fSound the retreat! $0e$0eHead back to#base and regroup!$0f
As long as I'm here,$0e#you'll never get through!$0f
Yo, Andy...$0e#You Ok?$0f
Max! $0eHow was I?$0e#Did you watch the whole thing?$0f
Yeah...$0eI watched.$0e$0e#That was a little close.$0f
Hey! $0eThose tanks back there...$0e$0e#Are those your troops, Max?$0f
Hm? $0eOh, um...$0ethose are...$0f
Commander Max! $0eWe received your#orders and moved out at once!$0f
Well, no one ordered you to broadcast#it to the entire world, soldier!$0f
Hmmm...$0f
What?!?$0fIt's a training exercise!$0e$0e Gotta check#those engines every now and then!$0fGeez... $0eC'mon, boys. $0eLet's go home.$0f
You know, Nell, $0eI'm really glad to have#Max on our side!$0f
So am I, Andy. $0eSo am I.$0f
I did it!!!#Did you see that?!?
It's too bad, Andy,$0e but#you were beaten this time.$0f
Ahh... $0eLet me try again! $0eRight now!$0f
Calm down. $0e$0eI've got some advice for#you, $0eand I want you to listen.$0fIt's tough facing both the Black#Cannon and the mini-cannons, too.$0fHowever, $0efocusing only on the#mini-cannon in front of you$0fexposes you to attack.$0fOne tactic is to send quick units#between the mini-cannons to$0fsuppress and capture the factory.$0fBut first, you need to shut down#enemy deployment capabilites.$0fGood luck, Andy. $0e$0eGet out there and#show Max what you can do!$0f
Mistress Lash, $0ewe have reports that#Orange Star is closing on our position.$0f
Hmmm...$0f
What would you like us to do?$0f
Just go and $0eengage them or something.$0f
Engage them...$0eor something?$0f
Uh, yeah. $0e$0eI'm a little busy researching#my latest invention right now. $0eDuh!$0fOnce this is finished, $0eI'll bathe#all of Orange Star in a sea of fire...$0fOooh! $0eI love new toys!$0f
Um...$0e That is... $0e$0eI'm not$0e#sure we can do this on our own.$0f
Ah! $0eYou're hopeless! $0e$0e#Fine! Let's get this over with!$0f
The Black Hole HQ is located in those#mountains, isn't it?$0f
That's correct. $0e$0eIt seems that Lash is#working on another destructive device.$0f
So, $0ewe need to launch an assault,#capture their HQ, and shut her down.$0fIf all goes well, we might get some#intel on Black Hole's forces, too.$0f
Being able to move in the mountains$0e#is key to making this work.$0f
Which is why you chose me for this#mission.$0e I understand.$0f
We have reports of Black Cannons#and missile silos in the mountains, too.$0fThis isn't going to be a walk#in the park, Sami. $0e$0eBe careful!$0f
I will. $0eYou can count on me!$0f
Pfeh! $0eNo big deal. $0e$0eIt's not like this#is our only hidden base!$0fToodles! Hee hee hee...$0f
Anything to report, Sami?$0f
No sign of any of Lash's files yet.$0f
Oh...$0f
They're thorough, I'll give them that.$0fHardly any time to evacuate,$0e but they#still managed to destroy her notes.$0f
Well, $0e$0eI'm sure we'll have more chances#to gather intel in the future.$0fWe captured an enemy HQ today,$0e#and that's good work.$0f
You're right. $0eThere's still a lot of#ground to cover...$0fWe need to move ahead base by base$0e#and ensure that we take 'em all!$0f
This is just the#beginning!
Sami! $0eAre you Ok?$0f
I'm sorry, Nell.$0e$0e#You believed in me, $0eand I let you down.$0f
Yes, I believed in you. $0e$0eAnd I#still do. $0eYou can do this, Sami.$0fUp and at 'em, soldier.$0e$0e#We've got some planning to do!$0fFirst and foremost, we need to take#those factories at the top of the map.$0f
Yes, I agree.$0fDeploying rocket units here would make#taking out the Black Cannons easier.$0f
Missile silos are useless against#the Black Cannons, $0eso just$0fignore them.$0fMountains impede vehicle movement,$0e#so utilizing your superior infantry$0funits is your best strategy.$0fGet your troops over those mountains,$0e$0e#and hit 'em hard! $0eGood luck, Sami!$0f
Commander, $0ewe've received a letter#from the enemy.$0f
Addressed to me?$0e$0e#I wonder what it says...$0f
Sir?$0e$0e#What does it say?$0f
It's a challenge.$0fIt says, "If you're not a coward, you'll#come to the coordinates on this map."$0f
What are your orders, sir?$0f
We're moving out, of course!$0fYou think I'm scared of Black Hole?$0e#Not a chance!$0f
So, $0ethis is the place...$0f
That it is, $0eAndy.$0f
Hey! $0eWho are you supposed to be?$0f
I am Hawke.$0e$0e#A Black Hole CO.$0f
Why did you send that letter#to me?$0f
I wanted to meet you.$0e$0e#To challenge you...man-to-man.$0f
What, you wanna fight?$0f
That's right. $0e$0eI hoped you'd show me#your tactical prowess.$0fI gather you have immense potential.$0e#Unpolished, but great nonetheless.$0fI require a skilled foe. $0ePerhaps you#would be an appropriate enemy.$0fPlus, $0eno one else has been able#to contain your...$0eyouthful energy.$0f
What are you talking about?!?$0fI have no clue who you are!$0f
Meet me in combat, boy,$0e and#you will learn all you need.$0fWell, $0ewhat will it be?$0e$0e#Will you accept my challenge?$0f
If you're selling, $0ethen I'm buying!$0f
Just what I expected to hear.$0fHere are the rules: $0eWe use only#air and naval units.$0fThe first to lose every unit...$0e#loses the battle.$0f
And if I win?$0f
Then I will return this area to the#control of Orange Star.$0f
Ok! $0e$0eThen if I lose, $0eI'll let Black Hole#take possession of this land.$0f
Quite generous...$0econsidering that we#already have control of this region.$0fIt is done! $0e$0eLet it begin, Andy!$0f
Here I come!$0f
How was THAT, Hawke?!?$0f
Hm... $0eQuite impressive, Andy.$0e$0e#Victory is yours.$0f
Now, like you promised,$0e#pack up and get out!$0f
It seems I've no choice.$0e$0e#All units, $0ewithdraw!$0f
Commander, $0ethe Black Hole forces#are retreating!$0f
Yeah! $0eWe did it!$0fI've gotta tell Nell.$0e$0e#Put me in touch with her right away!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Andy?$0e#What in the world are you doing?$0f
Nell, $0elisten to this.$0fI beat this guy named Hawke and#drove his troops out of...$0f
I don't have time for that!$0fOrange Star is under attack!$0e#The enemy is here in massive numbers!$0f
What?!?$0f
They've advanced beyond the front#you were supposed to be holding!$0f
Uh, $0ethat means...$0f
You fell right into their trap, Andy!$0e$0e#Get back here on the double!$0f
But...$0ebut... $0eWhat about...$0f
If the continent falls, $0ethose islands#mean nothing!!!$0f
Hmmm...$0f
Commander... $0eCommander!$0e#Awaiting your orders, sir!$0f
Back to the mainland! $0eNOW!!!$0e$0e#Drat! $0eDouble drat!!!$0f
That creep!$0e Next time I#see him, $0ehe's in trouble!
I lost?$0f
Ha ha ha... $0eI came looking for an#opponent, $0ebut all I found was a child.$0fI'll hold you to your word, boy.$0e#This land is ours!$0f
Wai...$0ewait!$0f
What? $0eBegging for mercy?$0e Or do#you think to challenge me again?$0fYou? $0eA child who doesn't know how to#gather intel $0eor field an army!$0fI beat you once, boy. $0eAre you coming#back for more?$0f
Yes... $0eYes, I am!$0e#I can't let it end like this!$0fHawke! $0eThis time, I challenge you!$0e#Fight me!$0f
Ha ha ha... $0eWhy not?$0e$0e#I'm ready when you are.$0f
What have you done with the Orange#Star soldiers we captured?$0f
They've been taken to HQ, as per#your orders, sir.$0f
And you have permitted that intel#to be leaked back to Orange Star?$0f
Yes, sir. $0e$0eReports tell us they began#gathering forces almost immediately.$0f 
Who is in command?$0f
Our sources report that a#Commander Max...$0f
Max? $0eIs that so?$0e$0e#Like a moth to a flame...$0fCapture his comrades, $0ehint at doing#something horrible, $0eand out he comes.$0fMax... $0eYou poor, heroic fool.$0f
Our troops have been deployed, as#you ordered, sir.$0f
Then let us begin. $0eIt's time to teach#that human battering ram a lesson.$0fWhen we're done with him, $0eMax'll have#nightmares about indirect-combat units.$0f
What're you saying, Nell?$0e$0e#Are you ordering me NOT to attack?$0f
Of course not, Max.$0fI'm advising that you take time to#assess the situation. $0eThat's all.$0f
It's the same thing!$0f
The enemy has indirect-combat units#deployed in the middle of their army.$0fAttack with the troops you have now,$0e#and you'll play right into their hands.$0f
So I should do nothing?$0e$0e#Let 'em get away with this?$0f
No, Max. $0eJust wait $0eand redeploy#your forces.$0f
While I'm doing that, $0ewho knows what#they'll do to the troops they captured!$0f
.........$0f
C'mon, Nell!$0e#You've gotta let me go.$0fThose soldiers were captured because#we messed up.$0fI've gotta save 'em!$0f
I can hardly say no if you put#it like that, can I?$0fHowever, $0eyou must proceed with#caution. $0e$0eUnderstood?$0f
Thanks, Nell! $0e$0eI knew you'd#understand.$0fI'll talk to you later!$0f
Wait! $0eMax!$0e$0e#...$0eI hope this works.$0f
Hsss... $0eMy perfect plan...#It's not possible...$0f
Is everyone Ok?$0f
Commander!$0e#Are we ever glad to see you!$0f
You got here in the nick of time, sir!$0fA Black Hole CO named Lash was#going to use us in some experiment!$0f
What? $0eAn experiment? $0e$0eGood thing#we got here when we did!$0f
Sir! $0eYes, sir!$0e$0e#Thank you, sir!$0f
Max. $0e$0eDidn't I warn you about rushing#headlong into enemy territory?$0f
Oh, $0eNell.$0fMy...$0emy apologies.$0e$0e#I got a little $0eworked up...$0f
You really do have a short fuse,#don't you?$0fWell, I'll let it slide this time.$0f
Let it slide?$0f
Thanks to you, $0eall these soldiers#will make it home safely.$0fIt was your decisive command that#made rescuing them possible.$0fNicely done,$0e$0e#Commander Max.$0f
Aw, $0ethanks.$0e#Heh heh...$0f
Hah! It'll take more#than that to beat me!
Heh heh heh... $0eJust as I planned.$0e My#trap was as flawless as my face is.$0fA victory worthy of my genius!$0e$0e#Or was my foe simply too dull-witted?$0f
Commander!$0e#Are you all right?$0f
Yes, I'm fine!$0e#Blast! $0eI got ahead of myself!$0fCan't see into the woods in this$0e#stupid Fog of War.$0fNo matter how worried I am about the#captives, $0eI've got to be more careful!$0f
Do you see that?$0e#It's a Black Hole lab.$0fIf this goes well, $0ewe might be able#to seize their new weapon designs.$0f
Nell! $0eWe're ready to advance!$0e$0e#But...$0eshouldn't this be Sami's mission?$0f
No can do, Andy!$0e$0e#I'm still gathering my troops.$0fMy last battle left me with a shortage#of combat-ready soldiers.$0fTo be honest, $0eI'd like to try and#infiltrate their base by myself.$0f
Do you honestly think that I would#approve such recklessness?$0f
It's Ok, Sami! $0e$0eHelping each#other is what we're all about!$0fMy troops are fresh, and itching#to go!$0f
Lord Flak!$0e$0e#The Orange Star Army!$0f
What?$0e$0e#How did they find us here?!?$0f
I...$0eI don't know, sir.$0e$0e#Maybe a map fell into their hands?$0f
Grrrr!$0fHow long will it take to erase all#of the weapon data?$0f
10... $0eNo, we should be able to do#it if we have 7 days.$0f
Well, get started!$0e$0e#Don't let them get that intel!$0f
Lord Flak... $0e$0eThe new weapons plans#have been stolen...$0f
.........$0e$0e#Assemble everyone in the factory.$0f
In the factory...$0e#Yes, sir!$0f
All right!$0e$0e#We shut down the enemy lab!$0f
Excellent work, in spite of the#difficult conditions.$0fWith these plans, $0ewe should be able to#develop neotanks of our own.$0fThis was a great victory.$0e$0e#Let's head for home and celebrate!$0f
Wahoo! $0eLet's have a BBQ!$0f
Oh, no...$0e$0e#I got beaten...$0f
Hey! $0eScram!!!$0e$0e#The lab's gonna blow!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Drat!$0e#We didn't make it in time!$0f
Nothing we can do now...$0fPursuing them will only cause more#damage. $0e$0eLet them go.$0f
Nell seemed a bit $0edisappointed.$0f
Uh-huh. $0e$0eThis battle was all about#getting those weapon plans...$0fBut, $0ehey, $0eI'm just glad you're Ok.$0e$0e#C'mon! $0eShow me that Andy spirit!$0f
You're right!$0e#We'll get 'em next time!$0f
Yes!$0e#That's what I wanted to hear!$0f
I can't wait to try#out a neotank!
Oh, no...$0e$0e#I got beat...$0f
Andy, $0ejust because you're in a hurry#doesn't mean you can panic!$0fYou have to utilize your recon units$0e#and send infantry into the mountains.$0fYou need to do everything you can to#increase your visual range!$0f
Plus, $0eif you advance carelessly, you#leave your indirect-combat units open.$0fHaving easy terrain to cross doesn't#mean you can let your guard down.$0f
Ok...$0fBoy, why do I feel like I just got#chewed out by my mom?$0f
Andy! $0eI'm not like Nell! $0eI'm not old#enough to be your mother!$0f
Not like Nell? $0eWould you care to#explain that comment, Sami?$0f
Oh,...$0eum...$0enot really. I...$0f
They've come at last...$0e#I'll win it all with this factory.$0f
You look like you're having a rough#time, Flak.$0f
Huh?$0e What rock did you crawl out#from under, Adder?$0f
Heh heh heh... $0e$0eI wanted to see the#military strength of this nation myself.$0f
Should you even be here?$0fI thought you were supposed to be#invading Yellow Comet?$0f
Leave off, Flak. $0eYou'd do well not#to waste your energy on my affairs.$0fLook! $0eThe natives are knocking on#your doorstep...$0eand they look restless.$0f
Grrr...$0e#I won't lose.$0f
"Won't"? $0eHeh heh heh...$0fYou mustn't lose, Flak. $0eThat's#closer to the truth.$0f
.........$0f
I'm looking forward to your#performance. $0eHeh heh heh...$0f
Whoa!$0e$0e#What in the world is that?!?$0f
It seems to be some sort of an#installation.$0fWhat are they planning now?$0f
I believe they call it a factory.$0fThis is the center of all the damage#inflicted upon our forces.$0f
So there's no doubt that it's the#key to the entire Black Hole invasion!$0f
You're right, but...$0e#There's still so much we don't know.$0fI've got a spy on the inside,$0e#so I'll let you know if I hear anything.$0fIn the meanwhile, $0elet's launch some#sorties and see the enemy's response.$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0f
Got it!$0f
What is it, Nell?$0e#Is everything Ok?$0f
No, it isn't, Max. $0eOur army's not the#only thing taking damage here.$0fThe enemy's been stealing weapons,#money, and other materials, too!$0fSomehow, they transport everything#here to this factory, then it all$0fgoes into that pipe and winds#up...$0esomewhere else.$0f
Black Hole goons... $0eThey're even more#dangerous than we originally thought.$0f
Don't worry! $0e$0eAs long as we're in this#together, there's no way we can lose!$0f
You're right, Andy.$0fYou've all made it this far.$0e#I know you'll emerge victorious.$0f
You did it!$0fThere'll be no more units#coming from that factory!$0f
Aarrrgh!$0e$0e#Nooooooo!$0f
Give it up, Flak!$0e#You lose!$0f
My invasion of Orange Star may#have failed, but I'm not alone.$0fThere are other Black Hole COs,$0e#with more armies.$0f
What are you saying? $0eAre Yellow#Comet and Blue Moon under attack?$0f
Hah! $0eYou'll find out soon enough.$0fThey'll be coming for you next!$0e#I'm gone.$0f
Hey! $0eWe're not done with you!$0e$0e#...$0eHe got away again!$0fWe can't ignore his warning, can we?$0e#We've gotta contact the other armies.$0f
Yes. $0eYou're right.$0e#Let's ready reinforcements.$0fIn truth, though, $0eour own Orange Star#Army is in pretty ragged shape.$0fIf that battle had gone on much#longer, materials and morale might$0fhave dropped to dangerous levels.$0fI can't tell you how grateful I am#for all of your aid!$0e Nice work!$0f
C'mon! $0eLet's hurry and check on#the other armies!$0f
Yeah! $0eLet's get busy and drive those#Black Hole thugs off the planet!$0f
You said it! $0fWe'll knock the stuffing out of 'em,#then head home for a victory feast!$0f
I knew the enemy wasn't going to roll#over and let us win, but still...$0fListen! $0eWe made it this far, and$0e#I'm confident that you can win!$0fPerhaps this terrain is more suited#to Max's style of combat.$0fTrying different COs is a vital#piece of strategy, too.$0fGood luck, everyone!$0f
Wahoo!#I beat the bad guys!
Whew... I wonder how#our allies are doing.
Take that!#Orange Star is free!!!
Nell...$0eI'm sorry...$0f
I knew the enemy wasn't going to roll#over and let us win, but still...$0fListen! $0eWe made it this far,$0e#and I'm confident that you can win!$0f
Nell, $0ewhat should we target#to win the field?$0f
Let's see...$0fPerhaps your initial target should be#the base below the seam in the pipe.$0fIf it doesn't go as planned, $0eyou can#always try switching COs.$0fDirect assaults are Max's forte, $0eand#Sami's tops at capturing bases.$0fOf course, $0eAndy's good to go#anywhere with his repair skills.$0f
Let me have a shot! $0ePipes, tanks, or#whatever. $0eI'll take 'em out!$0f
That's the spirit!$0e#Good luck, everyone!$0f
This is terrible!$0fGrit!$0e$0e#Grit! $0eWhere are you?!$0f
I'm right here.$0fWhat is it, $0eOlaf?$0f
An attack!$0e$0e#Black Hole has launched an attack!$0f
Hm?$0e$0e#Black Hole?$0fThat name sounds kinda familiar...$0e#Where they from again?$0f
Fool!$0e They're the same group that#tore up Blue Moon in the past.$0fWe must attack and drive them#from Blue Moon borders!$0f
Good gracious.$0e#I don't see what all the fuss is about.$0fIt's just dirt and trees and$0e$0e stuff.$0e#It's not like we're losing it.$0f
We ARE losing it, you fool!$0fIt's this type of impertinence that#has our army...$0f
Reporting for duty, sir!$0f
And who are you supposed to be?$0f
Colin, sir!$0e My posting to#headquarters begins today!$0f
Aha!$0e#The new CO!$0fGood.$0e You will watch, listen, and#learn! $0eYour training starts now!$0f
Sir! $0eYes, sir!$0e$0e#Thank you, sir!$0f
Howdy, son.$0f
Howd--$0esir!$0f
Whoa, now. $0eRelax a bit.$0e$0e#No sense gettin' all worked up.$0fTake things nice and easy,$0e#and you'll be all right.$0f
Sir! $0eYes, sir!$0e$0e#Nice and easy, sir!$0f
That man is a disgrace!$0e$0e#You will NOT follow his example!$0fNow let's move out.$0e$0e#Everyone, follow my lead!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
You, too, Grit!$0f
Right behind you, sir.$0f
Ah! $0eNo, no, no.$0e#Don't touch that spoon.$0fWe'll both be sent flying if you#do that, Flak.$0f
Don't leave such dangerous $0e$0estuff$0e#lying around here.$0f
And why not?$0fThis IS my playground, after all.$0f
They're coming.$0e$0e#Are you ready?$0f
Naturally!$0fI was getting tired of this place#anyway, so the timing's perfect.$0fThis is going to be so much fun!$0f
Let's keep moving!$0e$0e#Everyone, advance!$0fThere's a city up ahead.$0e$0e#We can rest there.$0f
Commander, $0eyou're certainly in#high spirits today.$0f
Yeah, $0eis it snowing up ahead or#something?$0f
Pardon me, Commander...$0e$0e#May I ask what lies ahead?$0f
Hah! $0eIt's about time someone asked#me that!$0fTo be honest, $0ewe'll soon arrive in the#town where I was born!$0f
What's that? $0eYour hometown?$0f
That's right.$0fIt's been a long time since I left#to join the army.$0fI imagine everyone will be surprised to#see how far I've risen in the world.$0fHo ho, yes!$0f
So you're really just excited about#showing 'em how important you are.$0fWatch out, y'all!$0e Olaf's comin' home!$0f
The city's coming into view, sir.$0e$0e#It's...$0e It's...$0f
What!?$0e#What's happened here?$0f
Welcome to my playground!$0fSince you've come so far,$0e#would you like to play?$0f
You... $0eYou fiend!$0e$0e#What have you done?$0f
Hm? $0eIs something wrong?$0e$0e#You don't like my playground?$0f
My home!$0e$0e#The town square!$0f
What are you talking about?$0e$0e#I don't see any of that stuff!$0fOh...$0e Those must be the places that#got broken during my field tests.$0fAnyway, $0eI've hidden a goody in one#of these properties.$0fThink you can find it?$0e#Tee hee hee!$0f
Grit...$0e Colin...$0e#Stay out of this!$0fThis fight is mine!!!$0f
Commander! $0e$0eWe recovered this#from a property we captured...$0f
Hm?$0e$0e#What's that?$0f
Well, I'll be... $0eWhat you've got there$0e#is a map pinpointing an enemy lab.$0f
A lab? $0eWhat do you mean?$0f
It's where the enemy's workin' on their#new weapons.$0fIt would make things a mite easier if#we could get some of those new$0fweapons for our side, too.$0f
Hmph! $0eI don't like it.$0e$0e#Using enemy weapons...$0f
Well, we know the location. $0e$0eLeast we#can do is stop in and take a look-see.$0f
Uh-oh.$0e$0e#This might be trouble...$0fOh, well.$0e$0e I guess I'll have to find#someplace new to play.$0fToodles!$0f
This is it.$0fThis is where my house used to be.$0f
Commander...$0f
And over there,$0e that was the#town square.$0fI played here all day with the other#kids in the neighborhood.$0fIt didn't matter how much snow was on#the ground. $0eIt didn't bother us at all.$0fLook, $0eright here...$0e Can you see#the outlines of the square?$0f
Olaf...$0f
Black Hole!$0fFor this, $0ethere can be no forgiveness!$0f
I'll continue fighting until#my country is restored!
My...$0e My hometown...$0f
Aw, no... $0e$0eYou lost.$0fOlaf, $0eyou've gotta get control#of the base in the center there.$0fThen you use your indirect-combat#units to lay down some protective fire.$0fWith my dead-eye marksmanship, it#would be as easy as pecan pie, but...$0f
Quiet!$0e I don't need any help.$0fI'll protect my home with my own#two hands. $0eYou'll see.$0f
My, oh my...$0f
My... $0eMy hometown...$0f
Aw, no... $0e$0eYou lost.$0fOlaf, $0eyou've gotta get control#of the base in the center there.$0fIf you get greedy and try to advance#too far, though, $0eyou'll pay the price.$0fUse your indirect-combat units to lay#some protective fire over this base.$0fWith my dead-eye marksmanship, it#would be as easy as pecan pie, but...$0f
Quiet!$0e I don't need any help.$0fI'll protect my home with my own#two hands. $0eYou'll see.$0f
My, oh my...$0f
Grit!$0fGrit!$0e$0e#Curses, man! $0eWhat are you doing?!$0f
Uhh?$0fWho...$0e What's all the ruckus?$0e#Even the chickens are still sleepin'.$0fOh, $0eOlaf...$0e$0e#Yaaaaawwwnn!$0f
Open your eyes and get up, you lazy#scoundrel!$0fI entrusted the defense of these#mountains to you!$0fWho do you think you are,$0e#lollygagging about like...$0f
Calm down there, O Bearded One.$0e#No need to get all riled up.$0fIf things get a bit dicey, $0ewe can#always sound the retreat.$0fI doubt the enemy's gonna do anything#too rash.$0f
You fool!$0e$0e#Let me tell you something...$0f
......$0f
What? $0eWhat is it?$0fDon't attempt to divert my wrath with#that dour look of yours!$0f
I do believe that someone's payin'#us a visit.$0f
What?$0fGrit! $0eWhere do you think you're#going?$0e$0e Grit!$0f
Shoot...$0e#Will you look at all them Md tanks!$0fGoin' head-to-head with those boys#makes no sense at all.$0f
Very perceptive,$0e#Commander Grit.$0f
Black Hole Army, huh?$0f
My name is Adder.$0fI came here specifically to offer you a#proposition.$0f
A proposition?$0f
Yes. $0eLet me cut to the chase.$0fWe'd like you to join the Black Hole#Army.$0e What do you say?$0f
Pardon?$0f
You possess much skill...$0e Wasting it#for Blue Moon is such a shame.$0fYou don't really buy into the whole#"protect and serve" business, right?$0fDying to save a country you care#nothing for? $0eAdmit it. $0eIt's nonsense.$0f
......$0f
You can see with your own eyes,$0e#the might of our army.$0fWe passed through several cities#on our way here...$0fHeh heh... $0eCrushing them beneath#our boots took no time at all.$0f
......$0f
Be it Blue Moon or any other country,$0e#no one can stop us.$0fCome, Grit. $0eYou know that joining#us is the smart thing to do.$0f
Well now...$0e#You got one thing right.$0fI never did care much which territory#belonged to which country.$0fI couldn't have cared less if y'all#decided to set up shop here.$0f
Heh heh heh...$0e#In that case...$0f
However...$0f
Hm?$0f
However...$0fYou've got no call to be treating the#folks who live here any way you please.$0f
What?!?$0f
You destroyed whole cities?$0e$0e#You did just say that, right?$0fWell, listen here,$0e I don't care#how powerful you say you are...$0fYou, $0eAdder,$0e are now my number-#one enemy.$0f
Heh heh...$0e If that's the way you want#it,$0e I'll destroy you here as well!$0fMd tanks, $0eadvance!$0e$0e#Grind this fool to dust!$0f
Huh?$0e$0e What're those things on the#right of the map?$0fHey, Olaf!$0e#What in tarnation are they?$0f
Those $0eare missile silos.$0fInfantry and mech units can use them#to launch a single missile.$0fThey can strike anything on the#field of battle.$0f
Well I'll be... $0eA distance weapon...$0fThat's nice. $0e$0eI wonder which of us#has the better range of fire.$0f
Fool! $0eIt's a weapon, not a rival!$0fThose missiles have a wide blast#radius,$0e so watch for your own troops.$0fYou can get more info about the#silo by pressing the R Button.$0f
Zippity doo dah!$0f
How...$0fWhat happened?$0fMy Md tank brigade...$0e#Routed?$0fHsss!$0e$0e#Retreat!$0f
Grit!$0e$0e#Where are you, Grit?$0fForcing that villain Adder to retreat,$0e#it was quite...$0f
Hm? $0eWhat was that?$0fSomething I can do for you, Frosty?$0f
You...$0eyou impertinent fool!$0fIs this the way you speak to your#commander?$0fStand right there!$0e$0e#I'm going to teach you a lesson!$0f
Not in front of the boy.$0fHey, son, $0eI'm gonna catch some#shut-eye. $0eYou're in charge.$0f
Um...$0e Huh?!$0e$0e#Me? $0eDid you mean me?$0f
Aarrgh!$0e$0e#Grit! $0eHold it right there!$0f
This ain't for show.
My rocket units plum got whooped.$0e#That's one tough enemy.$0f
He refused my offer... $0eHeh heh heh...$0e#Crushing such a fool is easy.$0fEvery time he shows his face,$0e I will#defeat him again.$0fMech units, $0escale the mountains and#attack while he focuses on the tanks!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
The failure of artillery is that they#can't fire on enemies close to them.$0fSince I'm well aware of that,$0e#victory will be mine. $0eHeh heh heh!$0f
What did you say?$0e$0e Black Hole's#on our northern frontier?$0f
Yes, sir. $0eThey show every indication#of attacking right away.$0f
Hmmm. $0eBut, why?$0e$0e#There's nothing of importance there.$0f
Maybe that's the reason.$0f
What do you mean?$0f
Well, $0ethere's nothing there,$0e so maybe#they figure the defenses are weak.$0f
How should we respond?$0fWe could get there soon enough, $0ebut it#may be a trap.$0e We can't be careless.$0f
That might be part of their plan, too.$0e$0e#Ha ha, $0ethat's downright crafty.$0f
We're not here to admire them!$0e$0e#Someone has to go... $0eMe or Grit...$0f
I'll go!$0f
You?$0f
You and Commander Grit should#remain here, correct?$0fWell, $0ethat leaves me!$0f
Now there's a good idea.$0e$0e#Let's send the youngster.$0f
Grit, $0eyou lazy...$0e#The boy's as green as can be.$0f
That may be true, $0ebut he's been#fulfilling his CO duties without a hitch.$0fI say it's high time we start treating#him like a full-fledged CO.$0f
Hmmm...$0eI see what you're saying, but...$0f
It's all settled then.$0fColin, $0ehead up north, $0eand#defeat the enemy!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Easy, son. $0eRelax a bit,$0e#and do what you can.$0f
Uh...$0eand troop morale?$0e$0e#If I'm not paying attention...$0f
Don't mistake what I said now.$0fBeing relaxed and being careless#aren't the same thing.$0fThe lives of your troops hang on#the decisions you make out there.$0fI know you're excited, $0eand that's not#bad. $0eJust remember moderation. $0eOK?$0f
Sir! $0eYes, sir!$0e$0e#Thank you, sir!$0f
Mistress Lash,$0e#Blue Moon troops have been spotted.$0f
Well, it's about time.$0e$0e#Who's in command?$0f
It's...$0e#A young boy CO named Colin.$0f
Huh? $0eThat kid?$0e$0e#How boring is that?$0fI wanted the bearded geezer,$0e#or at least the scarecrow.$0f
What are your orders?$0fDo you want the troops to attack?$0f
It's not going to be any fun#if neither of 'em shows up.$0fSound the retreat.$0f
Er...ma'am?$0f
Oh, $0eOK.$0e$0e Let's just attack#and wipe 'em all out.$0fTee hee hee!$0f
Boo!$0e#Nothing's going right!$0fThat's enough. $0eI'm going home!$0f
Mis...Mistress Lash?$0e#Wait for us!$0f
Did they really retreat?$0f
No doubt about it.$0e$0e#We've secured the enemy HQ, sir.$0f
I accomplished my mission!$0e$0e#Wow, $0eis that a relief!$0f
Your command was...$0e#Audacious, sir.$0f
Thank you.$0e$0e#I'm glad you think so.$0fI've just got to keep this up and drive#Black Hole out as soon as possible.$0f
This is just the#beginning!
Tee hee hee!$0e$0e I'm the winner!$0e#The winner is me!$0fSend that boy out again!$0e#He makes a good toy!$0f
Oh...$0e How am I going to face#Commanders Olaf and Grit?$0f
Keep your chin up, Commander!$0f
You... You're right. $0e$0eThe lives of#my troops hang on my decisions...$0fOK! $0eHere we go!$0e$0e First, we#capture the airport in the middle$0fand use that as a stepping stone to#the enemy HQ.$0fI was given this command on faith,$0e#and I won't betray that faith!$0f
Tee hee hee!$0e$0e I'm the winner!$0e#The winner is me!$0fSend that boy out again!$0e#He makes a good toy!$0f
Mistress Lash,$0e that laser cannon is#causing damage to our troops as well.$0f
What's your point?$0e$0e As long as the#enemy's getting hit, who cares?$0f
That laser's a danger to both my#troops and the enemy, too.$0fThat's it! $0eIf I can just lure the foe#within range of their own weapon...$0fI was given this command on faith,$0e#and I won't betray that faith!$0f
Omigosh!$0e#Commander Olaf!$0fLook at that!$0e#It's... It's...$0f
What...$0e#What...$0fWhat in winter's name is that?!?$0f
It looks like a missile silo...$0e#A really big missile silo.$0fI doubt we can just walk up#and push that monster over.$0f
Hit it with everything we've got!$0fNo Black Hole base is a match#for our might!$0f
Do you see the size of that thing?$0e$0e#I'm worried about you, Chief.$0f
Wha-$0eWhat should WE do?$0f
Well, son, $0eyou and I are on intel duty.$0fWe've gotta find a way to beat#that thing.$0f
Now that Olaf's here, your days are#numbered!$0f
I'm here to help!$0f
Hmph! $0eIt's Andy of Orange Star.$0e#What are you doing here?$0f
I just told you...$0e#I'm here to help.$0f
Blue Moon needs no aid! $0eWe have the#power to...$0f
That's a giant missile silo.$0fWhen 15 days have passed, $0eit'll#launch a missile!$0fThat missile will take out half of#Blue Moon's troops in one blow.$0f
Madness!$0f
That's what Nell said anyway.$0f
That... That's...$0e$0e#We must stop that missile!$0f
I'll help you!$0e$0e#Let's stop that missile together!$0f
Grumble grumble...$0e#If you're going to insist, $0eyou can help!$0f
Olaf? $0eCan you hear me?$0fWe found a way to put the kibosh#on that giant missile base.$0f
What was that?$0e$0e#Are you sure?$0f
There are 8 properties surrounding#the launch tower.$0fThey're supplying the power for the#base to launch the missile.$0fIf you can capture those 8 properties,#the tower should be helpless.$0fIt's up to you, Frosty!$0f
I'll take care of this!$0e$0e#Easier said than done...$0fThis accursed pipe is preventing#my units from advancing!$0f
If you blow up that seam, $0eyou can#pass through the hole in the pipe.$0fThat's what Nell told me!$0f
Oh, $0eyes...$0fOf course! I already knew that!$0e#I thank you all the same, though.$0f
Mmmm...$0e Day 7 so soon...$0e$0e#If 15 days pass, $0ewe lose...$0fWe must hurry and capture those#8 properties.$0f
Mmmmmmmmmmm...$0e$0e#Today's the day.$0e We must act now!$0f
It's our turn! $0eLet's move out!$0f
B-$0eB-$0eBlast it!$0fIf we could've launched this missile,$0e#we would've blown 'em all to bits!$0f
Yes! $0eWe've captured them all!$0e$0e#That neutralizes the missile silo!$0f
Wahoo!$0e$0e#We won!$0f
Right!$0e$0e#We did it!$0fOf course, I could've done it myself.$0fWhat are your plans now, whelp?$0fIf you like, $0eI will let you continue#to battle here in Blue Moon...$0f
I'm gonna head back to Orange Star#for now.$0f
Hm? $0eYou're leaving already?$0f
I'll be back as soon as everyone at#home's ready to go!$0f
Oh, $0eis that so?$0e#Well then, $0esee you aga...$0fNo, wait!$0e$0e There's no need for#you to come again.$0f
I won!#...That is...$0ewe won!
I wasn't much help...sorry.$0f
I never asked for your help in the#first place!$0fThe blame is mine alone...$0f
C'mon now, $0ethere's no reason for#y'all to be so downhearted.$0fI was thinkin'...$0e You can't cross that#pipe, $0ebut neither can the enemy.$0fSo what if you leave that lower#section intact?$0fJust a thought, you know?$0e It's your#command, so do what you think best.$0f
I believe in the two of you!$0e#I know you can do it!$0f
Yeah! $0eNext time I'll show you what I#can do! $0eLeave the upper units to me!$0f
Hold it, Andy!$0e#The first blow shall be mine!$0f
Colin! $0eYou're in command now.$0fGrit and I are returning to HQ to#plan our continued strategy.$0f
Yes, sir! $0eUnderstood, sir!$0fI'll guard these properties for the$0e#next 14 days.$0f
Mmm.$0e$0e#No need to worry.$0fAccording to our intel division, there's#no chance of the enemy striking here.$0fYou're one-hundred percent safe.$0f
But our intel division ain't the most#reliable bunch of fellas.$0fDo your best, son.$0e$0e#We'll be back to get ya in 14 days.$0f
I won't let you down, sir!$0fI'm a Blue Moon CO after all!$0f
Commander Colin!$0f
Yes?$0f
It's an attack!$0e#The Black Hole Army's here!$0f
What? $0e$0eJust like that?$0fStay calm.$0e Stay calm.$0e#Must not panic.$0fI...must...be...strong!$0e$0e#OK! Tighten the defenses!$0f
Helloooooo!$0e#Is anybody home?$0fLooks deserted! $0eGuess I'll just#capture everything.$0f
Not so fast.$0e$0e These properties...$0eare#under...$0emy protection.$0f
Just you?$0e$0e#Talk about easy.$0f
Uh...$0e$0e#Reinforcements are on their way!$0f
Yeah, $0elike in 14 days, right?$0e$0e#I'll capture everything by then.$0fC'mon, troops! $0eFire at will!$0f
Keep strong, everyone!$0fWe just have to protect the HQ#for 14 days!$0f
Today's the...$0eeighth day.$0e$0e#Just over halfway...$0fI've got to stay strong!$0fI will hold out for 14 days!$0f
Hey! $0eYou OK, son?$0f
Grit!$0f
Tsk!$0e Time's up.$0fAll I'll gain now are more casualties.$0e#Guess it's time to disappear!$0fToodles!$0f
Nice work, son.$0fHolding out against a superior force#that, I mean.$0f
Commander Grit?$0fDoes this mean I'm worthy of being a#commanding officer now?$0f
What're you talkin' about?$0fYou are a grade-A certified top-of-#the-line CO, son!$0fAnd you can take that to the bank!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
I'll continue to do#my best!
Oh, no.$0e I failed in my duty.$0f
Tee hee hee!$0e$0e That was too easy!$0fI can't believe he didn't realize he#only had to protect that narrow area!$0fIf it were me, I'd just plug up the road#and blast away from the rear with$0findirect-combat units.$0fA CO as bad as that isn't even#worth toying with.$0f
I'm so sorry, everyone...$0e Give it#one more try!$0e Just one more!$0fYou don't have to fight to win.$0e$0e#You only need to last 14 days!$0f
All right, everyone.$0e#Keep up the pace!$0fVictory lies just beyond those woods.$0fNow, more than ever, we need#Blue Moon to be strong...$0f
Hold it right there, Boss!$0f
How dare you!$0e$0e#I'm talking to the troops!$0f
We're walking into an ambush.$0e$0e#There are enemy units in those woods.$0f
Madness!$0f
And that ain't all! $0eThey've got some#crazy weapons pointed right at us.$0fMy, oh my...$0e Getting through this#is gonna take some doin'.$0f
What should we do?$0f
Don't fret none.$0e$0e#This one's mine.$0fI figure my abilities are best suited#to take on those monster cannons.$0f
Truthfully, Grit.$0e$0e Are you sure#you can handle this?$0f
I believe I'll muddle through somehow.$0f
So, $0ethey sent you, did they?$0fBlue Moon CO Grit.$0fYour CO Power is Snipe Attack...$0fYou're an indirect-combat unit#specialist. $0eDid I miss anything?$0f
You know your stuff, don't you,#princess?$0f
It's no big deal.$0e#I AM a genius, you know.$0fThe Black Cannon's my invention, too.$0f
Black Cannon, huh?$0e$0e#What's it do?$0f
Do you really want to know?$0fWell, its range of fire is much,#much larger than yours.$0fAnd I've tweaked it so it can now#fire every day!$0fI'm gonna destroy you way before you#reach your goal.$0f
I see...$0fI reckon I'll have to sneak along#through the woods then.$0f
Are you seriously going to try it?$0f
I suppose I am.$0fI'm sure those cannons are as#powerful as can be, $0ebut being the$0fbiggest don't always mean you're#the best.$0fI think I'm gonna have to teach#you a lesson, princess.$0f
Yikes! $0e$0eI'm so scared!$0e$0e$0e NOT!$0f
Listen up, soldiers!$0fOur goal $0eis to reach our HQ on the#far side of these woods.$0fUnit type is not a factor.$0e$0e Any#one of you reaches the HQ, we win.$0fAs long as you're in the woods,$0e you're#safe from cannon fire, $0eso rest there.$0fNow, we cannot allow the HQ to be#captured. $0eSo if you run into any$0fenemy infantry, be sure to give 'em#somethin' to remember you by.$0fAll right, $0elet's move out!$0f
No way!$0e#They made it through?$0fI can't be defeated here...$0e#It's not possible!$0f
You remember this day, princess.$0fThis is where you learned what it#means to make Blue Moon your enemy.$0f
Don't worry, I'll remember.$0e$0e#Remember that I have to crush you!$0fNext time we meet, $0ethe result will#be different!$0fToodles!$0f
My, oh my...$0e#Glad to see the end of that.$0f
That was great, Commander Grit!$0f
Well done, Grit!$0fAfter today, I can see the day of our#ultimate victory approaching!$0fAll we need to do is march out to#meet it!$0e$0e Let's march!$0f
I hope they don't come#any tougher'n that.
What happened, Grit?$0fWasn't your superior indirect-combat#skill supposed to save the day?$0f
Don't get your feathers all ruffled up#now, Boss.$0e$0e Some days are luckier$0fthan others. $0eStill, I don't like losin'.$0e#Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.$0fSo what say I take another crack#at this?$0f
Commander Grit?$0e Er...$0eI noticed the#wheeled units had trouble in the woods.$0fYou might try keeping APCs handy to#supply them as they advance.$0fI'm sorry if I've overstepped my place.$0f
Not at all, Colin.$0fI appreciate the advice. $0e$0eI'll try#and be worthy of it next time.$0f
This is absolutely inexcusable!$0f
What's wrong now? $0eGetting all worked#up like that ain't good for you, Boss.$0f
Doesn't this bother you at all, Grit?$0fThese Black Hole mercenaries!$0fThey trespass on our land and have#the gall to build wherever they like!$0fThis land is ours!$0e$0e More than any-#thing else, it belongs to our people!$0fWe cannot allow these fools to invade#it and divide it amongst themselves!$0f
The man's got a point...$0f
Commander Olaf! $0eThere's a base or#something up ahead!$0f
Just like the map said.$0fWhich means we've found their#research laboratory.$0f
Troops! $0ePrepare for battle!$0f
A research laboratory?$0e$0e#They won't get away with this!$0f
You've gone too far!$0f
Hand over the new weapon plans!$0f
Intruders detected.$0fDefensive system$0e#Backlash initiated...$0fTaking damage from intruders.$0e#Initiate document-destruct sequence.$0fResearch lab will self-destruct$0e#in 15 days.$0f
Research lab will self-destruct#at the end of the day.$0f
Research lab self-destructing.$0f
Got 'em!$0e$0e#We found the weapon plans!$0f
With these plans,$0e we'll be able to#use this new weapon in the next battle.$0f
Start building new weapons!$0e$0e I'll#be waiting at the next battlefield.$0f
With this new weapon, no#one's a match for us!
Well, now... This should#make things easier.
The new weapon plans!#We really got them!
How did this happen?$0fNot only were we defeated, $0ebut#the weapon plans are...gone!$0f
The enemy really dug in on this one.$0fBoss, what do you think about startin'#with that base near the bridge?$0fIf you've got that, $0eclosing in on#the HQ becomes a whole lot easier.$0fColin, you got anything to add to#the discussion, son?$0f
Uh...$0ewell...$0e You should be careful#not to let the foe steal your missiles...$0f
OK, then! $0eWe focus on the base and#the missiles, $0eand then advance.$0fHow's that sound to you, Boss?$0f
Hmmm...$0e That's exactly what I had#planned!$0e Let's go, troops! $0eMove out!$0f
Uh-oh!$0e When did they arrive here#at the factory?$0fAre we in trouble?$0f
You're a reckless little thing, aren't#you?$0fHow do you plan on explaining this#to Hawke?$0fFlak!$0e The factory's too close#to those silos!$0fWhat happens if it gets hit with#a missile?$0f
I hadn't thought of that...$0f
Tee hee hee!$0e Those missiles won't#even scratch my Lash Armor!$0fAnd that pipe seam is totally#wrapped in the stuff!$0fI can't wait to start using my#factory to make them miserable!$0f
Don't worry, Adder.$0e$0e#Lash has a plan.$0f
I can deploy any unit I like, right?$0e$0e#Tee hee hee...$0f
I wonder if those two can handle this...$0f
Grit!$0e$0e#Are we ready?$0e Grit!$0f
Yessiree, Boss. $0eReady when you are.$0f
Um...$0e The commander-in-chief#of Orange Star is approaching.$0f
Orange Star?$0e$0e#Hmm...$0e Show her in.$0f
It's been a long time, Olaf.$0f
Hmph! $0eNell...$0fWhat are you doing here?$0e$0e#I didn't request reinforcements.$0f
No, but I did.$0f
Grit!$0e$0e Why, you no-good...$0fAre you familiar with the concept of#"chain of command"?$0f
Commander Olaf, $0eCommander Grit did#what he thought best for Blue Moon!$0f
I know that, boy.$0e Now shush!$0f
This is a vital strategic location.$0e#Orange Star offers its aid.$0f
Seeing as this is our territory, I'm of#a mind to send you packing...$0fHowever, $0ewe are a bit shorthanded,$0e$0e#so I'll accept your offer.$0f
The Yellow Comet Army is also on#its way here.$0f
What?$0e$0e That self-styled samurai?$0f
That's right!$0e$0e#We'll defeat Black Hole together!$0f
Commander Olaf, $0ethe troops are#ready when you are, sir!$0f
Very well! $0eLet's not fall behind.$0e#Advance on all fronts!$0f
Brilliant work, Commander Grit...$0fSeeing Blue Moon's danger and#rallying our allies so quickly!$0f
Huh? $0eOh, that...$0e Anything to#keep from getting shot up, son.$0f
What?$0e That was your reasoning?$0fCommander Grit! $0eWait up, sir!$0f
Here's our chance to drive the Black#Hole Army out of Blue Moon!$0fI've been waiting for this!$0f
A fight in the woods...$0e#This'll be good practice!$0f
That itty-bitty girl's the enemy?$0e$0e#Is this some kind of joke?$0fIn any case, I'm good to go!$0f
Black Hole's dared invade Blue#Moon soil!$0fThey will now learn the price#of their audacity!$0f
Reckon I gotta take the field#this time 'round.$0fNow let's see if we can't#send these boys packin'!$0f
Father, $0eMother,$0e#people of Blue Moon...$0fI promise you...I will win!$0f
Fiends of Black Hole!$0e$0e#No longer will you run free!$0f
On this map, $0ethe airport is key...$0e$0e#How to get started...$0f
The girl's our opponent, eh?$0e#I'll give her the game of her life.$0f
It's our turn. Good luck, everyone!
And now, Yellow Comet...#Quickly! Follow Blue Moon!
Gimme a break! $0eWe lost again?$0e$0e#Retreat, retreat, retreeeeeeat!!!$0f
Mistress Lash!$0e$0e#Wait for us!$0f
Yes! $0eA victory for our army!$0e$0e#A victory for Blue Moon.$0f
Commander Olaf...$0e#Wow, $0ehe even cries big...$0f
More than anyone else I know,$0e the#boss lives for his country.$0fThose are tears of pure joy.$0f
Really?$0e$0e Commander Olaf is a#truly great leader!$0fOf course, so are you, Commander#Grit.$0f
Cut that out, Colin.$0e$0e I ain't#used to anyone singing my praises.$0f
Colin's right!!$0e$0e In fact,#you're both great commanders!$0fYou're the mold from which great#COs are made!$0fYou're the children of Blue Moon!$0e$0e#You're MY children!$0f
YOUR children? $0eYou tryin' to scare#old Colin half to death?$0f
Howdy, Andy... $0e$0eListen, junior...$0f
Howdy, Sami.$0e Listen, sweetheart...$0f
Together again, eh, big dog?$0e#Listen, Max...$0f
Howdy, Kanbei.$0e Listen, commander...$0f
Howdy, Sonja.$0e Listen, darlin'...$0f
Howdy, Sensei.$0e Listen up...$0f
I want to thank y'all for being#so neighborly and helpin' us out.$0fThis war's gonna drag on a bit,$0e so#we'll return the favor someday soon.$0fSo long.$0f
Uh,$0e Commander Grit! $0eWait for me!$0f
Thanking others for their goodwill is#nothing to be shy about!$0fThe ability to express gratitude is#as beautiful as the aurora itself!$0fGrit! $0eColin!$0f
It looks like peace has returned#to Blue Moon.$0f
Their COs get along well, don't they?$0e$0e#They look like a happy family.$0f
You think so?$0e$0e They looked a bit#dysfunctional to me.$0f
Blue Moon's safe and sound.$0e$0e#Let's head for home.$0f
I won!
That Lash has a lot of skill...
How do you like that?#That's a Max-size beatdown!
Glory to Blue Moon!
Maybe now I can get#some shut-eye.
I only won because#of everyone's help!
Evil must know the#taste of defeat!
Blue Moon's been liberated.#I wonder where the enemy is now.
Wo ho ho.#That was some battle.
We were defeated in full view of#our allies.$0fGrrr...$0e We've got to stop that#factory from deploying troops.$0fAha! $0ePerhaps that gate can be#blocked. $0eA good idea, mm?$0f
Sure, $0ethat's something to think about...$0e$0e#By the way, Boss...$0f
What is it now, Grit?$0f
What do ya think of havin' our allies#capture that airport on the left?$0fIf they do that, they may be able to#target that pipe directly.$0fAs large as my range of fire is,$0e#marchin' straight on in there$0fain't gonna be easy...$0f
That's it, Commander Grit!$0fWe'll hold the enemy's attention#while our allies circle in from behind...$0f
It's settled then!$0fColin!$0e Inform everyone of my#brilliant plan!$0f
Um...$0eyes, sir!$0f
My, oh my...$0f
It looks as though Yellow Comet#and Blue Moon have given the foe$0fthe old heave-ho, Eagle.$0f
That just leaves Green Earth.$0f
Over half of our country is under#enemy control, though.$0f
Yes.$0e And it's high time we took it#back, Drake.$0f
Are we launching a counteroffensive?$0e$0e#Perhaps I can lend a hand.$0f
Jess, $0eyou're back!$0f
Yes, I am.$0fI couldn't continue my training#abroad with my homeland in danger.$0f
Your timing couldn't be better!$0fIt's become a ground war, and neither#Eagle nor I are any good at that.$0f
Knock it off, Drake!$0fShe delayed returning until she knew#she'd be met with fanfare, that's all!$0f
What are you talking about?$0f
Stow it, Eagle.$0f
The enemy took us by surprise,#nothing more.$0fI can liberate Green Earth on my own,$0e#without you underfoot, Red!$0f
Jess, don't mind him.$0e$0e#He's angry is all.$0f
I'm not worried about him.$0fI was just thinking that the more#things change...$0f
You know, $0ewith Eagle in the skies, $0eme#at sea, $0eand you on the ground,$0fwe're nigh invincible!$0e Let's go get#our country back!$0f
Adder, $0ewill the fortress be completed#on schedule?$0f
Yes.$0e$0e#We're proceeding without delays.$0f
And the minicannons?$0f
All 8 of them have been constructed#on the sites you selected.$0f
Then all is well.$0f
Commander!$0fWe've reports of a large Green #Earth force heading this way!$0f
I estimated they'd be appearing about#this time.$0fThey're all air units?$0f
Hold on...$0e Er... I think so, sir.$0e#Nothing but air units, sir.$0f
How predictable.$0e$0e#Deploy our troops immediately.$0f
Yes, sir.$0f
Attention all units!$0e$0e#Target that fortress and open fire!$0f
Oh no!$0e Hold on, sir!$0fThis is no good!$0e$0e There are#anti-aircraft units everywhere!$0f
What?!$0e$0e They knew we were coming...$0f(What should I do?)$0f(If we allow them to complete that#factory, Green Earth will suffer.)$0f(If we press our attack, $0ewe might win,#but the casualties will be enormous.)$0f
Commander! $0eLet's continue with#the attack.$0f
But...$0f
We're Green Earth's strongest force.$0fWe cannot lose.$0fThat's what you always tell us,#isn't it?$0f
He's right, sir.$0e$0e We won't be beaten by#the likes of those Black Hole thugs.$0fAnd we can't sit by and let them#complete that fortress! $0eWe can't!$0f
Let's hit 'em, Commander!$0f
C'mon, sir!$0f
My soldiers.$0e.$0e.$0e$0e#All right, $0ewe proceed as planned.$0fAim for the heart of their offensive#power, $0ethe minicannons.$0fLet's give them a show of power they#won't soon forget!$0f
Commander!$0e$0e#The minicannons...$0e They're all...$0f
They've been destroyed?$0e$0e#That's it then. $0e$0eWe shall withdraw.$0f
Look at that!$0e$0e#The enemy's abandoning the fortress!$0f
It appears that we've won.$0f
Shall we launch a pursuit, sir?$0f
No, $0ewe deal with the fortress first.$0f
Yes, sir.$0f
You have my gratitude.$0fIt was your bravery that led me...$0e#...led US to victory.$0f
Thank you, sir.$0e We appreciate that.$0f
The war has just begun.$0fThe road before us will be long#and hard.$0f
No problem, sir.$0fAs long as you're in command,$0e#we can't lose!$0f
There is no one who#can defeat us.
I cannot believe we were defeated...$0f
That was the famed Green Earth Air#Force?$0e What a disappointment.$0f
Heh heh heh...$0e#As impressive as always, Hawke.$0fNothing but air units...$0e#Those cretins never stood a chance.$0fDestroy the bombers, and their ability#to inflict damage is neutralized.$0f
Adder, $0eyou talk too much.$0e$0e Finish#the fortress before they return.$0f
Leave it to me, and there will be no#problems. $0e$0eHeh heh heh...$0f
What are the enemy troops doing?$0f
They appear to be gathering on a #small island on the inland sea.$0f
And our troops have surrounded#the sea?$0f
Yes, sir.$0e$0e A complete wall encircles#them.$0fAll that remains is to destroy them#unit by unit with the Black Cannon.$0f
It's too early to relax.$0e$0e Much could#happen before they are annihilated.$0fTell the troops to keep on their toes.$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Enemy troops everywhere.$0fI've got to find a way to turn the#tides, or we'll all be swept away.$0fShould I weather that cannon's fire#in the reefs $0eor transport troops to$0fthe HQ with landers?$0f
Commander!$0e$0e#Incoming call from Commander Eagle!$0f
From Eagle?$0e$0e#Patch him through.$0f
Drake, $0eare you OK?$0f
Eagle? $0eWe've hit a patch of rough#sea here. $0eThe enemy's surrounded us.$0fWe've got to find a way to save the#troops...$0f
Hold on. $0e$0eI've got some good news#for you.$0f
What is it?$0f
I received a communique from Yellow#Comet.$0e$0e They've sent reinforcements!$0fAnd that's not all. $0e$0eThey're being led#by the emperor himself, $0eKanbei!$0f
That IS good news!$0fOK, $0eI'll launch a counteroffensive#timed with Kanbei's attack.$0f
You'll be aiming to take out those#2 Black Cannons, right?$0f
Yep.$0e$0e We can mop up the rest of#the enemy once that's done.$0f
Understood. $0e$0eI'll request that Kanbei's#troops target the Black Cannons, too.$0f
Thanks, Eagle.$0e You have this old#sailor's gratitude.$0f
Save it for the victory celebration.$0e$0e#Good luck to you, Drake.$0f
Commander.$0e$0e Black Hole appears to#have the inland sea surrounded.$0f
What do we know of Green Earth's#Commander Drake?$0f
He's unharmed, sir.$0f
Let's establish our field HQ.$0e$0e When#that's done, we'll send out the troops.$0fOur mission is to eradicate the 2#Black Cannons.$0fYou think you've got Drake where you#want him, Black Hole?$0fPrepare to taste steel from both#sides!$0f
So now the Yellow Comet Army#has arrived.$0fIf they use those missile silos, it #may prove problematic.$0fCan the cannons withstand direct#missile fire?$0f
Yes, sir.$0e$0e Mistress Lash says the#missiles won't even leave scratches.$0f
If that's true, we're safe.$0fThey don't have many troops#deployed yet, do they?$0fAttack immediately.$0e An ounce of#prevention as they say.$0f
The Black Cannons were destroyed.$0e$0e#Useless hunks of--$0fWe'll withdraw for the moment.$0e$0e#Adjust our preparations.$0f
Commander Kanbei!$0f
Ah, Commander Drake.$0e$0e#I am pleased to see you unharmed.$0f
You have our gratitude for the#reinforcements.$0fI believe we might have gone down with#our ships if you hadn't come.$0f
Nonsense. $0eEven surrounded, I believe#you would have turned the tables and$0femerged victorious.$0e#We simply sped the process up a bit.$0f
Thanks for the vote of confidence.$0f
I would like to battle at your#side again someday.$0f
The feeling's mutual.$0fMaybe when we're storming Black#Hole's fortress...$0f
May that day come soon.$0e$0e#Until then, good-bye.$0f
Good-bye!$0f
That was some rough#sailing!
Barnacles!$0fMy apologies, Commander Kanbei.$0e$0e#I failed us both...$0f
Do not let your spirit fail, Drake.$0e$0e#We will surely win the next battle.$0fAfter all, $0eKanbei is at your side!$0fAllow me to handle the land battle.$0e#You attack from the seas.$0fAs you advance, hide your battleships#in reefs to keep them from cannons.$0f
That's it!$0fUse the reefs to cover my advance,$0e#then blast away with my battleships.$0fExcellent strategy, Commander#Kanbei!$0f
Actually, $0emy daughter suggested that#strategy to me earlier!$0e Ha ha ha!$0f
Mistress Lash, $0ethe battleships in need#of repair have all been docked.$0f
Let's get started then.$0f
Before that, $0ewe'd better reply to#Commander Hawke's question.$0f
Oh,$0e what a pain!$0e$0e#What did he want again?$0f
The estimated time on the repairs.$0e$0e#Can they be done in 30 days?$0f
17 days.$0f
Excuse me?$0f
Under my brilliant direction, $0ethe#repairs will take 17 days.$0fNot 30, $0e17.$0f
However, the workers...$0e#Can they handle that pace?$0f
If we don't have enough manpower,$0e#we'll simply borrow some soldiers.$0fThe units sent to hide the lab map#have returned, haven't they?$0fAnyway, $0ewe'll have them done#in 17 days!$0f
Yes...um...OK.$0f
We've received word the battleships#have docked. $0e$0eNot long now.$0f
Jess, can you really pull this off#with this many troops?$0fIt's still not too late for Eagle#or me to provide reinforcements.$0f
The more troops, $0ethe longer it takes#to get organized.$0fTime is of the essence here.$0e$0e We must#attack before the repairs are done!$0f
That's true, but...$0fIf the enemy captures that airport,$0e#they'll deploy B copters and bombers.$0fAt any rate, $0eyou're in for rough seas.$0f
Take a look, Drake.$0e$0e#For air units, I've got my A-airs.$0fI'm going to bathe those battleships#in artillery fire!$0e Watch and see!$0f
What? $0eWe're under attack?!$0fThat's not fair!$0e$0e#We're in the middle of repairs!$0f
What are your orders,#Mistress Lash?$0f
What are my orders?$0e$0e#Counterattack, you twerp!$0f
So, we'll need to push back the#deadline on repairs...$0f
No way!$0f
But... But...the deadline...$0f
STOP SAYING THAT!$0e Just do as#you're told.$0e NOW!$0f
Mistress Lash.$0e$0e We have one day#remaining to finish repairs.$0f
I know, I know.$0e$0e#I'm busy right now. $0eCome back later.$0f
Perhaps we should rethink the#deadline after all...$0f
You're such a pest!$0e$0e#We're almost finished!$0fIf you have enough time to keep#jabbering at me, then help!$0f
Yaaah!$0e Let me go!$0e Please!$0f
Commander!$0e$0e We found this in a#property we captured...$0f
Hm? $0e$0eA lab...$0e They've been developing#weapons within our borders.$0fSince they went to the trouble,$0e let's#take the weapons along with this map.$0fWe need to let Eagle know about this.$0e$0e#He definitely won't stand for it.$0f
Yes, ma'am.$0e Understood.$0f
These Black Hole goons really are#trouble.$0f
Commander, $0ethe enemy battleships#have all been sunk.$0f
Well done.$0e$0e#Prepare to withdraw.$0f
Withdraw?$0f
We've achieved our goal.$0fLet's vanish before they send out#more troops.$0f
Yes, ma'am. $0eWe'll get started right#away.$0f
Stick and move...$0e$0e#That's just like you, Jess.$0f
No sense getting caught up in the#moment and getting your troops hurt.$0fWe seriously reduced the enemy's#firepower...$0e That's enough for now.$0f
When you're right, you're right.$0e$0e#I'll help get your troops out of there.$0f
Aaaaah!!!$0e What are you doing?!$0fWe can't fix the battleships if#they're all sunk, can we?!$0f
What... What should we do?$0f
What else is there to do?$0e#We attack with all of our strength!$0fThey've made me mad, $0eand now#they're gonna pay big time!$0f
Mistress Lash, $0ethat's...$0f
Hm?$0f
The enemy's gone.$0f
What?$0f
There's no sign of enemy units.$0fIt seems they've done what they set#out to do and left.$0f
You've got to be joking!$0e$0e They#just sank my boats and took off?$0fI...am...so...angry!!!$0f
OK, $0ethe repairs are completed.$0e$0e#Take the ships out right away.$0f
We still have troops engaged#in combat...$0f
Oh...$0ewell, leave 'em.$0f
Is that...$0eacceptable?$0f
If I say we're leaving, then we're#leaving.$0e$0e Now let's go!$0f
This should make things#a little easier for us.
OK, $0ethe repairs are completed.$0e$0e#Take the ships out right away.$0f

If I say we're leaving, then we're#leaving.$0e$0e Now let's go!$0f
Commander, $0ethe battleships have#begun leaving port.$0f
Shoot...$0ewe're too late.$0e#I guess I need to rework my strategy.$0fI underestimated the enemy's repair#skills.$0e$0e I'll have to work faster$0fnext time, too.$0fI probably don't have time to rest#injured troops, $0eso I'll have to$0fcombine units and join them.$0e$0e#Wait a minute! $0eThat's it!$0fThe enemy will join injured units, too.$0fWhen units merge, the overall number#is reduced.$0e I might be able to use that.$0f
Lash,$0e how's the laser cannon coming?$0f
Full steam ahead!$0fI've tweaked it so it can fire every#single day! $0eIt's sooo dangerous!!!$0f
Heh heh heh... $0eDelicious...$0e#How's Flak?$0f
My troops've been deployed,#like you wanted.$0f
At last, we will neutralize the#Orange Star Army completely.$0f
Why is Orange Star even here?$0fWe're in Green Earth now, aren't we?$0f
It seems they're here bearing supplies.$0e#Meddlers!$0e They shouldn't have come!$0f
So are we going to attack soon?$0f
No. $0eFirst, we suggest they surrender.$0e#Their CO's a young girl, you know.$0fPerhaps she can be convinced to come#along quietly.$0e Heh heh heh...$0f
C'mon, everyone! $0eStay tough!$0fGreen Earth's reinforcements are on#their way.$0e$0e Just hang on!$0f
Commander, we have a communique#from the Black Hole Army.$0f
What does it say?$0f
They recommend we surrender.#They're awaiting our response.$0f
Surrender?!$0fRight, here's my reply, $0eand I want#you to take this down word for word...$0f
Commander!$0e$0e Black Hole has demanded#that Orange Star surrender.$0f
Hm... I believe Sami's commanding the#Orange Star forces...$0fWhat was her reply?$0f
Well, in a word,$0e she turned#them down flat.$0f
What exactly did she say?$0f
Um...$0e I'd rather not say. It$0e wasn't#the most...$0epolite response.$0f
No. $0eFirst, we suggest they surrender.$0e#Their CO's a young girl, you know.$0fPerhaps she can be convinced to come#along quietly.$0e Heh heh heh...$0f
st they surrender.$0e#Their CO's a young girl, you know.$0fPerhaps she can be convinced to come#along quietly.$0e Heh heh heh...$0f
nvinced to come#along quietly.$0e Heh heh heh...$0f
..$0f
veryone! $0eStay tough!$0fGreen Earth's reinforcements are on#their way.$0e$0e Just hang on!$0f
Er...$0e Yes, sir, it would.$0f
Get anyone who's available ready#for combat.$0e$0e We go now!$0f
Sir,$0e the enemy outnumbers us by...$0f
There's no reason for us to attack#them head-on.$0fEither we pour everything at their#laser cannon $0eor we capture their$0fproperties.$0e One of the two.$0fOur goal is to break their siege.$0e#That's all.$0fFor the pride of Green Earth,$0e#let's save the Orange Star Army!$0f
Commander, $0ewe successfully joined#up with the Orange Star Army.$0f
OK.$0e Now guard them.$0fOur purpose here is to save the#Orange Star troops.$0f
Are you all right, Sami?$0f
Eagle! $0eSo it was you who saved us.$0fI apologize.$0e$0e I never meant to#be a burden on Green Earth.$0f
Don't be foolish.$0f
We were trying to bring you supplies,#and we let ourselves get surrounded...$0f
Everyone makes mistakes.$0e$0e It#turned out all right. $0e$0eLet it go.$0f
Yes, but...$0f
Sami, $0eI'm not just saying this to#save your wounded pride.$0fOrange Star came here to fight#alongside Green Earth.$0fThat alone has raised the morale#of our troops more than you know.$0f
Thank you, Eagle.$0f
I should be thanking you.$0fWe're very grateful for the supplies.$0e$0e#I think they'll ease our burden a bit.$0f
Eagle...$0f
I will not permit the#enemy a moment's rest!
Commander!$0e#Black Hole has beaten us...$0f
NO!!$0e$0e#We arrived too late...$0fThere's no time to hesitate.$0e$0e#All right, $0ethere's a change in plans.$0fSend everyone at the laser!$0e The#only properties we need are airports!$0fAbove all else, $0ewe must strike before#our ally is routed!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Lash, is the airport completed?$0f
Yep!$0e I built it to your specs, but...$0f
But what?$0f
Are you sure you want a standard#airport?$0e$0e Lemme add some options!$0f
Options?$0e$0e#What are you talking about?$0f
You know, all kinds of stuff.$0e$0e#Like a self-destruct system.$0f
Not necessary.$0f
Tsk! $0eBoooooring!$0f
If it's ready,$0e I'd like to use it now.$0e$0e#The enemy is close at hand.$0f
Go ahead, be my guest.$0f
The enemy's built an airport?$0f
They'll finish it shortly, sir.$0f
You didn't notice this earlier?$0f
They must have hidden it somehow.$0fPlus, they built it in such a short#amount of time. $0eAmazing speed.$0f
I see...$0fThanks for the intel.$0e Good work.$0f
Yes, sir. $0eThank you, sir.$0f
They must've realized I'm the only one#who can sail these waters.$0fPlanes vs. boats...$0e Air units do#have powerful advantages, but...$0fI'm not sunk yet! $0e$0eThis sea dog's#got a few tricks up his sleeve!$0f
Naval units repelling a superior#air force?$0e Quite a feat.$0fIt seems I underestimated my opponent.$0fThis war's far from over, though.$0fThe only battle I have to win#is the final one.$0f
The enemy is retreating on all fronts.$0f
It looks like we won. $0eSomehow...$0f
So I'm here for no reason, eh?$0f
Eagle!$0e$0e#You came to lend a hand!$0f
I heard the enemy was mainly air units.$0fI left the front under the command of#the subcommander,$0fbut it looks like I worried for nothing.$0f
I got lucky.$0f
It was more than luck.$0f
How so?$0f
Drake, $0eyou're a gifted tactician.$0e#You should give yourself more credit.$0fYou do realize you defeated an army#comprising mainly air units, right?$0f
It's nothing you or Jess couldn't have#done.$0e I'm not so...$0f
Perhaps it's your humility that#people find so appealing...$0f
Blow me down...#We finally won.
Barnacles! $0eWe lost...$0e$0e#I can't face Eagle or Jess like this.$0f
Commander Drake, $0eshall we request#assistance from another CO?$0f
No, I don't think so.$0e$0e#Let's take another run at it.$0fFirst, we've got to capture the base#in the middle as soon as possible.$0fI can only load 2 units onto my#landers, but...$0fI can load APCs carrying infantry,$0e#which doubles my transport maximum.$0fYep, $0elet's see what we can do.$0e$0e#No need to ask for help just yet!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Barnacles! $0eWe lost...$0e$0e#I can't face Eagle or Jess like this.$0f
Commander Drake, $0eshall we request#assistance from another CO?$0f
No, I don't think so.$0e$0e#Let's take another run at it.$0fFirst, we have to shoot down that#initial wave of planes.$0fWe've got to check movement ranges#so that we always attack first.$0fThen we've got to capture the base#in the middle. The little islands can be$0fdealt with later.$0fYep, $0elet's see what we can do.$0e$0e#No need to ask for help just yet!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Hawke, $0eFlak's here.$0f
Why? He's supposed to be implementing#my plan elsewhere.$0f
He said he's got something to talk#to you about.$0f
Very well.$0e$0e#Send him in.$0f
Heard you were launching an attack.$0f
Yes.$0f
Near the volcano.$0f
That's correct.$0f
Sounds dangerous.$0f
Which is why we're doing it.$0fThe volcano disrupts the air currents.$0fOur enemies will be unable to use#their best troops, their air force.$0f
But there's lava flying everywhere.$0e#Our own troops are being injured, too.$0f
Which means what to us, exactly?$0fAny losses we incur are acceptable#in the name of victory.$0f
But the strength of the enemy forces#attacking my front...$0f
Now I see.$0e This is all about you.$0fPretending to be concerned about the#troops when it's your own skin...$0f
Whuh!?$0e$0e No, that's--$0f
Before you question my plans again,$0fI suggest you win a battle with one#of your own devising.$0f
......$0f
The lava's going to make little#people pancakes!$0e$0e Tee hee hee!$0f
The enemy's preparing an attack near#the volcano?$0f
What're you going to do, Eagle?$0e$0e#You can't fly near that thing.$0f
In that case, $0ewe'll meet the foe#on the ground.$0f
Hold on, Eagle!$0e$0e You know you're not#at your best on the ground.$0fLet me take care of this.$0e$0e#Ground combat's my specialty.$0f
Hey! $0eJess!$0e#Stop right--$0f
She's gone.$0f
Does she think she can decide who's#going?$0e$0e Who does she...$0f
Eagle...$0e Jess is right.$0e$0e#Let her take care of this.$0f
Yes, I know she's right.$0e$0e#I'm just$0e$0e letting off steam.$0f
Jess, $0ecan you hear me?$0f
Eagle? $0e$0eWhat is it?$0f
It seems that the lava from the#volcano falls in a set pattern.$0fIf you can decipher it, you might be#able to use it to your advantage.$0f
That's good intel. $0e$0eThanks.$0f
Don't endanger yourself by trying#anything foolish.$0e$0e Luck be with you.$0f
They've made it this far.$0e$0e#We should withdraw for now.$0f
Tell the troops they fought well#under these terrible conditions.$0fTell them I'm proud of them.$0f
Yes, ma'am.$0f
Jess, $0ethat was well done.$0f
It was all the soldiers' doing.$0e$0e#I just nudged them along.$0f
That's exactly right.$0f
Eagle, $0estow that bilge.$0f
However, $0eyou weren't terrible, Red.$0e$0e#Try to continue not screwing up.$0f
Now, $0ehold on a minute, Eagle...$0fWhere did he go?$0f
Jess, believe it or not,$0e he meant#that as a compliment.$0f
I know that.$0fI was just wondering if he couldn't#find a better way to do it.$0f
Looks like I survived#another day.
My inexperience caused me to lose#those soldiers...$0eright in front of me...$0f
Jess.$0f
Eagle...$0fI took off without authorization, and#this is what I get.$0e Go ahead and laugh.$0f
I'm not the type to kick a person when#she's down.$0fJess.$0e$0e Everything else aside,$0e you are#a gifted ground tactician. $0eIt's a fact.$0fI believe, even under these conditions,$0e#that you can defeat Hawke.$0fIf you really value your troops, don't#let their sacrifices be for nothing.$0fPull yourself together and finish#this battle!$0f
I'm so disappointed, but Eagle's right.$0fTo have a chance, I have to suppress#the bases to the top and to the right.$0fIf I can get the enemy to focus on one,$0e#I might be able to capture the other.$0fI also have to think about the lava#pattern and how to use it...$0f
According to the map we recovered,$0e#the lab should be in this area.$0f
So the freebooters are working#on some sort of new tank?$0f
Perhaps.$0f
From what we know, the contingent#guarding the place is fairly small.$0f
So if we're going to attack, $0ewe#should do it now.$0f
I agree.$0f
Hmmm...$0f
What is it?$0f
You two can agree on something.$0f
We're both trying to come up with a#plan to save Green Earth.$0fIt seems to me that sharing some of#the same opinions is only natural.$0f
That's right.$0e$0e#Eagle's exactly right.$0f
OK.$0e$0e Say no more.$0f
There is one thing that concerns me,#though.$0fThe enemy has a large force#heading this way.$0f
When will they arrive?$0f
According to our intel, $0ein 10 days.$0f
So we must capture the lab by then.$0e$0e#It's going to be a hectic 9 days.$0f
I will get the enemy's new tank.$0f
I bet that new tank would improve my#combat prowess.$0f
With that new tank,$0e I'm sure our#casualties would drop.$0f
Day 9 already?$0e$0e#I'll clean things up today!$0f
Day 9...$0e Gotta finish up today.$0e$0e#Ahoy, mateys! $0eLook alive!$0f
The enemy battalion arrives tomorrow.$0e#I must complete the mission today.$0f
Well? $0e$0eDid you find the plans#for the new tank?$0f
I heard that they'd just been found.$0f
This brings us one step closer to#matching the enemy's strength.$0f
Uh-huh.$0e$0e I'm looking forward to#trying out those new tanks.$0f
At last, $0ea chance to demonstrate#my specialty.$0f
Excuse me? $0eEagle, you're just a#glorified flyboy, right?$0fLeave those new tanks to the ground-#combat expert. $0eThat's me!$0f
Who's a glorified flyboy?!$0fIf we leave these new tanks in your#hands, Red, $0ethey'll be wasted!$0f
What did you say?!$0e$0e#I dare you to say that again, Eagle!$0f
Stop it, you two!$0fWhew...$0e And it all comes back to#an argument.$0fI wish this were more than just#an excuse for you two to fight.$0f
These tanks will cement#our victory.
With these new tanks,#nothing scares me.
I'll be happy if these#help save allied lives.
Eagle. $0eJess.$0e$0e#Let's try this again.$0fIf we destroy that pipe correctly,$0e#I think we can divide the enemy.$0f
You're right, Drake.$0fBut this Fog of War makes moving#tough.$0e$0e We've gotta use our$0fvision range and advance cautiously.$0f
Wrong. $0eWouldn't it be faster to swoop#in and rout the enemy completely?$0fWith my air units, $0eit would be...$0f
You never change, Eagle.$0e Your#tactics are too reckless to--$0f
And you're too deliberate, Red.$0e#You sit, sit, sit,$0e and nothing else!$0f
By Neptune's beard!$0e$0e Stop your#caterwauling, you two.$0fAll you ever do is fight!$0f
Lord Hawke, $0ethe enemy has finished#establishing their field HQ.$0f
It has come to this...$0ebrought to bay#against our own factory.$0f
Hawke...$0f
Here, Lord Sturm.$0f
Explain yourself.$0e$0e The enemy has#routed your wretched companions...$0fAnd here you are, cringing like a dog#with its tail between its legs.$0f
......$0f
Protect my factory at any cost.$0fIf you fail, $0eyou will know no#peace and no forgiveness, cur.$0f
Yes, my liege.$0f
As soon as we're ready, $0ebegin the#attack on that factory.$0f
Think we can handle this on our own?$0fIt looks like Black Hole is mustering#all its troops.$0f
This war won't end until we destroy#that factory.$0fIf we don't do this, no one will.$0f
That's not exactly true.$0f
Commander Kanbei!$0f
If we pool our might and fight as one,#our chance of victory increases.$0fIsn't that so, Nell?$0f
Yes, it is.$0e$0e We want to help as well.$0fBlue Moon can't send soldiers, $0ebut#their support is unwavering.$0f
I understand...$0e It's not like we've#been fighting this war on our own.$0f
Together, $0ewe stand strong.$0e$0e#Now let's go liberate Green Earth!$0f
It's almost time.$0e$0e I think air#units have the advantage here.$0f
It looks like Green Earth would have#an advantage with air units...$0fCan I navigate these waters?$0e Only#one way to find out! $0eAnchors aweigh!$0f
We definitely need air support here.$0fI hope this is the last battle.$0f
Here we turn the tables on the foe!$0fAs long as Kanbei is here,$0e#the enemy shall know no peace!$0f
We're closest to the factory.$0fThe keys to this battle are taking the#cannon and circling behind the enemy.$0f
That enemy CO seems like a#tough guy...$0fBut I see right through him, and#I'm going for his weak point!$0f
We're in charge of the land campaign!$0fWahoo!$0e I'm ready to go!$0f
That Hawke is a little scary...$0fBut I won't back down, $0eand I#won't lose a land battle!$0f
Leave the ground battle to me!$0fIt's time to let loose with a#good, old-fashioned beatdown!$0f
Is this the end?$0f
Commander?$0e#What are your orders, sir?$0f
Do as you please.$0f
Um...$0eand you, Commander?$0fYou're not planning on going down#with the...er...factory?$0f
Fool!$0e This place may be important,$0e#but I've no desire to die with it.$0fNow go! $0eIf you want to save your#skin, $0eyou must do it yourself!$0f
Yes, sir.$0f Farewell, sir.$0f
Hah...$0e This is one situation I never#expected myself to be in.$0fI survive, though.$0e And where there's#life, there is opportunity.$0f
The factory is captured!$0f
And the enemy CO?$0f
Missing in action, sir.$0e He disappeared#at the time the factory was secured.$0f
Really...$0e$0e Nice work, soldier.$0f
Thank you, ma'am!$0f
It's over at last.$0f
Mm.$0e Peace will now return to#Green Earth.$0f
Whew...$0e That's nice.$0f
Huh? $0eThat was unexpected.$0f
Hm? $0eWhat was?$0f
"Nice"? $0eI thought you'd be#more...$0eexcited.$0f
Oh, I'm thrilled.$0e#I just want to take a nap is all.$0fYaaaaawn! $0eI'm bushed!$0f
Hm hm hmm...$0f
Ha ha haa...$0f
Congratulations on your victory.$0e$0e#As your ally, we are very happy.$0f
We couldn't have done it without#your assistance.$0fOn behalf of the people of Green#Earth, I thank you.$0f
Hearing that makes the journey#worthwhile.$0f
Yes, it does.$0fNow,$0e Commander Eagle, $0eI think you#grasp the situation, but...$0f
Yes. $0eThe war is not yet finished.$0f
Correct.$0e You know where that pipe#leads...$0fUntil we've defeated Black Hole on#their own turf, $0ethe war will never$0ftruly be finished.$0f
It sounds like things are just going to#continue getting tougher.$0f
It's not like the combat we've seen#up to now has been child's play.$0fNo matter who the foe may be,$0e#we won't lose.$0f
Next is the enemy#citadel.
We did it! Green Earth#is free!
We made it...#I'm glad that's done.
Mm! A fight worthy of#a samurai.
All that's left is Black#Hole's citadel.
Woh ho ho ho! Just a#bunch of green recruits!
And that...is that!
I guess that wraps things#up here.
I'm tellin' you, there's#no way we can lose.
I can't believe one guy did that...$0e#Crud! $0eI am sooooo mad!$0f
The Black Cannons and the mini-#cannons are the problem.$0fThe sheer number of those things#makes advancing near impossible.$0f
You're right...$0e Maybe we should give#each army a specific role.$0f
A role?$0f
Yes.$0e$0e The first thing we need to do is#deal with the minicannons.$0fYou don't need to destroy them all$3b$0e#just clear a path.$0fOrange Star will follow the overland#route, $0eGreen Earth can attack from$0fthe sea and sky,$0e and...$0f
Yellow Comet will advance on the#factory.$0f
Exactly!$0e#As quick as ever, Sonja.$0f
We'll capture the base below the#factory $0eand target the pipe.$0f
All right, then.$0e Let's move out.$0e$0e#This time, $0evictory will be ours!$0f
Father!$0e$0e#Come quickly!$0f
Ah, Sonja.$0e#What good timing.$0fI can't seem to find my other sock...$0f
How many times must I tell you,#Father? $0e$0eThey're in the bottom--$0fOoh! $0eThere's no time for socks!$0e$0e#An emergency bulletin just arrived!$0fUnidentified troops have been sighted#all across Wars World!$0f
What?$0fPut all of our forces on alert!$0fThey must be ready to move on a#moment's notice!$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
Sonja, $0eis there anything else?$0f
Well, $0eat this point, we don't#know whose troops they are.$0fHowever, $0ewe must consider the#possibility that they're...$0f
Hostile forces...$0e#Yes, we must consider that.$0f
Sensei!$0e$0e#When did you arrive!?$0e Why...$0f
Can't an old man drop in and check#up on a former student, Kanbei?$0fIt doesn't sound like we'll have#time for tea and small talk, though.$0f
Does this mean we can count on your#assistance, Sensei?$0f
Father controls the land, $0eI gather#the intel, $0eand Sensei rules the skies!$0fBetween the three of us, we should be#able to react to anything that arises!$0f
Preparations complete, Commander!$0e$0e#Yellow Comet Army is ready to move!$0f
Listen to me! $0eWe march to war, and#we shall not be defeated!$0f
What are the conditions in this#region, Sonja?$0fEh? $0e$0eWhat's that?$0e#Danger!$0e Sound the alarm!$0f
Oh, Father, $0ecalm down!$0e$0e#That's no danger to us.$0fThose are the missile silos we#installed for our protection.$0fWith those, our country's self-defense#network is perfect!$0f
Mmmm... $0eAttacking from afar is not to#my liking,$0e but at times, it's unavoidable.$0fWhile we await the enemy, $0einstruct#me in the use of these...silos.$0f
Commander!$0e$0e#We're under attack!$0f
What?$0e$0e#The enemy is here?!$0f
Impossible!$0e$0e#It can't be!$0fMy intel reported no enemy troops#in this region...$0fThe silos! $0eThey're unguarded!$0e#The enemy is trying to take them!$0f
Don't worry, Sonja.$0e$0e#I will go.$0f
But...$0e But...$0fWhat if the enemy reaches them first?$0e$0e#You'll be...$0f
I am the leader of this country.$0e#I shall not fail in my duty.$0fMove out! $0eKanbei's forces ride!$0f
Father! $0eListen!$0fThe missile silos can only be operated#by infantry or mech units.$0fIf you reach them first, you'll$0e#be able to launch a single missile!$0f
I understand.$0fDo not fear, my loyal subjects.$0e$0e#Kanbei rides with you!$0f
I$0e-I don't believe it...$0e$0e#They were...stronger than me?$0fMust find a way...$0e#to escape...$0f
The enemy has been routed!$0f
I'm sorry, $0eFather.$0e$0e#I almost destroyed us all.$0f
What, your silos? $0eDon't be#ridiculous, Sonja.$0fIt is because of those silos that we#won here today.$0f
Father...$0f
There's no rest for the weary!$0fBattle awaits, and we must ride forth#to meet it!$0f
Raise your voices#in victory!
Take that!$0e#That's the power of Flak!$0f
Defeat...$0e It is bitter on my tongue...$0f
Father, $0eit is most important that you#protect the missile silos.$0fUse transports and infantry to keep#them from falling into enemy hands.$0fBlock the bridge and prevent the#enemy from advancing. $0eYou can do it!$0f
I apologize, Sonja.$0fNext time, I shall not waste the silos#you prepared!$0f
Take that!$0e#That's the power of Flak!$0f
Defeat...$0e It is bitter on my tongue...$0f
Father, $0eit is most important that you#protect the missile silos.$0fUse transports and infantry to keep#them from falling into enemy hands.$0fBlock the bridge and prevent the#enemy from advancing. $0eYou can do it!$0fOne more thing: $0edon't forget about#the two bases on the small islands.$0fEven if you can't capture them,$0e you#mustn't let the enemy take them.$0f
I apologize, Sonja.$0fNext time, I shall not waste the silos#you prepared!$0f
Are you sure the enemy is here?$0f
Yes. $0eSomewhere.$0e$0e#My reports say that...$0fEeeek!$0f
Sonja!$0e Are you all right?$0f
Ouch...$0f
Blood! $0eSonja, you're bleeding!$0e$0e#Quickly! $0ePrepare for a transfusion!$0f
Sir?$0f
Fa$0e-Father!$0e#Stop!$0fI just fell down.$0e$0e#Please stop overreacting.$0f
But $0eI'm worried.$0fIf anything ever happened to you,$0e#I don't know what I would do.$0fI knew it!$0e You should be in the rear.$0e#It's much safer there.$0f
Ooh! $0e$0eI am a Yellow Comet CO!$0fI can handle this responsibility!#I'll prove it to you!$0f
But, Sonja...$0e#I...$0f
Wait!$0e$0e#Father, $0elook at that!$0f
Hm?$0e$0e#That...$0e That's...$0f
A huge enemy stronghold?$0e$0e#When did that get there?$0f
How dare they build that monstrosity#on our sacred soil!$0fIt is time to clean the rust#from my blade!$0f
Patience, Father!$0e$0e#First, we need to reconnoiter.$0f
But...$0f
Intel is the most important part of#combat.$0fRushing blindly to war just increases#your casualties. $0eLeave this to me.$0f
Never!$0e$0e#It is too dangerous.$0f
I think you should let her go.$0f
Sensei?$0e$0e#I don't...$0f
Sonja is a respected CO in the#Yellow Comet Army.$0fBelieve in your daughter, Kanbei.$0e#It's the right thing to do.$0f
Hmmm...$0fSonja, $0eare you truly ready for this?$0f
One hundred percent!$0fI'm your daughter, aren't I?!$0e$0e#I'll prove I'm worthy to command.$0f
How to capture that giant fortress...$0fLooks like I need to smash those 8#cannons protecting it.$0fIf I can do that, $0ethe fortress will be#powerless, $0eand I'll win!$0fIt's either that or capture their HQ...$0f
Heh heh... $0eIt seems that this terrain#has our friends in a quandary.$0fNot that it matters. $0eWhatever they#decide to do, $0ethey can only fail.$0f
CO Adder of the Black Hole Army,#I presume.$0fI should have known Black Hole#was behind this!$0f
This fortress was built on the#strength of the Black Hole nation.$0fIt will never fall to the likes of#Yellow Comet.$0fOnce I've taken care of things here,$0e#I must destroy this map.$0fIt wouldn't do to have these fools#showing up at our hidden lab...$0fNow then, $0elet's see what skills#this foe possesses.$0f
Commander! $0eThis was found when we#captured a new base.$0f
Ah! $0eIt's a map! $0e$0eA map showing#the location of their lab!$0fThis must be where they're developing#those new weapons we've heard about.$0fPlease deliver this to my father!$0e$0e#He will send reinforcements for sure.$0f
Yes, ma'am!$0e$0e#I'll deliver it to CO Kanbei right away!$0f
Now, $0eI just have to do something#with this mess.$0f
What? $0eIt can't be!$0e$0e#Our beautiful fortress...$0fWe were unlucky, $0enothing more.$0fAnd so, $0efor now, $0ewe must retreat.$0f
Whew...$0e We won. Somehow, we won!$0f
Sonja!$0f
Father, $0edid you observe the battle?$0f
I did. $0e$0eThose were dangerous tactics#you employed, Daughter.$0fHowever, I was mistaken. $0e$0eYou were#the perfect CO to fight this fight.$0f
Father...$0f
However, $0ethis war is going to become#more dangerous, and more violent.$0fYou must never let your guard down.$0e$0e#Do you understand, Sonja?$0f
Yes, sir!$0e#I do!$0f
Perfect planning wins#the day!
No...$0e All my plans... They failed.$0f
Don't fret so, Sonja.$0e#Let's put our heads together.$0fDid you notice that there were only#two neutral bases here?$0f
You're right--there were!$0fIf we control them, the enemy won't#be able to deploy any new units...$0f
Yes, $0eyou understand perfectly.$0fYour vision range is superior to all#other COs$0e--that's an undeniable$0fadvantage in Fog of War.$0fSend out your recon units and locate#the enemy while you advance.$0fYou'll like the results!$0e Go, daughter#of Kanbei! $0eGlory awaits!$0f
Yes, sir!$0e#I'll do my best!$0f
Where are the supplies we've#plundered?$0f
They're en route to our factory even#as we speak, sir!$0f
So quickly? Excellent...$0fHeh heh. $0eOur plans are moving right#on schedule, eh?$0fEven so, $0ewhat a beautiful sea.$0fGazing upon it fills me with an#overwhelming desire to see it all...$0f...destroyed!$0f
We're under attack!$0e#It's Yellow Comet!$0f
So much for "me time" and tender#thoughts...$0fSend out the order for#reinforcements! $0e$0ePrepare for battle!$0f
This is difficult terrain...$0e#The land routes are so narrow.$0fEven if we move in numbers, $0ewe're#sure to take heavy casualties.$0f
Hmmm...$0e#I think I'll take a crack at it.$0f
Sensei?$0f
Just sit back and watch. $0e$0eWe'll see if#my air units can't do some good.$0fEven us old folks like to help out#now and again.$0f
What have we here?$0fHave they run out of beds in Yellow#Comet's infirmaries?$0f
So you're the Black Hole, eh?$0e$0e#What do you want here?$0f
I have no reason to tell you,#old man.$0fIn time, the entire world will kneel#at our feet.$0fAny who dare stand in our way will#be ground beneath our heels.$0f
Oh, can't have that, now can we?$0fI don't like war$0e--it's tiring.$0e$0e#But someone's got to stop you.$0fLet me tell you a little secret.$0fDid you know that when you join two#damaged units together,$0fand their combined HP is over 10,$0e the#surplus gets converted into funds?$0f
What are you babbling about?$0fDo you think some loose change is#going to sway the course of battle?$0fHeh heh heh...$0e Or are you just#worried about your pension?$0f
If you don't grasp what I'm#telling you, $0eboy,$0fthen you've got no hope#of defeating me.$0fHe who laughs last$0e laughs best.$0e#So long.$0f
You're quite the orator.$0e$0e Still, you're#a bit long in the tooth to challenge me.$0fSince you're so tired, $0eI'll make this#quick and finish you in 10 days!$0f
You...$0e You're an old man!$0e#For you to have defeated me...$0fWho...$0e Who are you?$0f
Sensei! $0eYou did it!$0e$0e#You are victorious!$0f
Hm? $0eI am?$0e$0e#Oh, that's nice.$0f
Wait! $0eNow I remember...$0e#It was in the reports...$0fThis country once boasted a CO#who was said to be unbeatable...$0fA man whom everyone feared...$0e#Impossible...$0e It couldn't be!$0f
Who, me?$0f
Uh...$0e$0e#Today was...$0eunlucky. $0eA bad day.$0fWe'll meet again, old...$0e$0e#This is not finished!$0f
Seemed to have pulled through#in one piece.$0fSonja?$0e#Are you all right?$0f
Sensei? $0eYou were unbeatable?$0e$0e#Everyone...$0efeared you?$0f
Who, me?$0e$0e Oh, that's so long#ago, I'd almost forgotten.$0fThere might have been a $0erumor of#that nature at some point, but...$0fCome now, $0ethere are battles yet#to be fought. $0eLet's go.$0f
Yes...$0e Yes, sir!$0f
Ho ho!#Guess that's that.
I lost, did I? $0eLooks like you can't#beat Father Time after all.$0f
That is untrue, Sensei!$0fYour battle copter skills are beyond#compare! $0eThis, Kanbei knows well!$0fIf that base and airport in the middle#of the field can be taken quickly,$0fI'm sure that victory will be yours!$0f
Heh heh heh...$0fFeel free to challenge me anytime,#old man.$0e I never turn down an$0feasy victory.$0f
I lost, did I? $0eLooks like you can't#beat Father Time after all.$0f
That is untrue, Sensei!$0fYour battle copter skills are beyond#compare! $0eThis, Kanbei knows well!$0f
He's right! $0eAnd your command of#infantry is spectacular, too!$0fThe best way to use those skills is to#capture the base next to the airport.$0fIf you can do that, I'm sure you'll win!$0f
Heh heh heh...$0fFeel free to challenge me anytime,#old man.$0e I never turn down an$0feasy victory.$0f
Commander Adder!$0fThe laser cannon has been deployed,#as you ordered.$0f
Very well.$0f
Adder, $0ehow you planning on using it#up on that mountain?$0f
Quite simple, really. I'm going#to lure the enemy in $0eand fire.$0f
What makes you think they'll come#all the way out here?$0f
I'm going to lay siege to their cities.$0fIf they don't come, $0eI'll tell the world#they permitted their cities be taken.$0fEither way, $0ewe can't lose.$0f
Hrmmm...$0f
More importantly, $0edid you deploy that#infantry as I requested?$0f
Put 'em just where you said.$0e$0e They're#pretty far from the cities.$0e$0e That OK?$0f
Yes. $0eThat's fine.$0e$0e#March them along slowly.$0fThey're merely bait for the enemy.$0fWouldn't want them capturing those#cities too quickly. $0eHeh heh heh...$0f
Father,$0e#hold your attack!$0f
Why, Sonja?$0fThe Black Hole Army is about to#lay siege to our cities.$0f
It's a trap.$0fThey're trying to lure us in.$0f
But we can't just sit here!$0f
Why not?$0fThat city isn't at all important,#strategically speaking.$0f
Sonja! $0eWhat are you?#What are we?$0f
What are we? $0e$0eWe're$0e COs in the#Yellow Comet Army.$0f
Correct. $0eAnd COs do not sit idly by#and watch their people be destroyed!$0fEven if it's a trap. $0eEven if it's not#strategically important.$0f
That's...$0f
We are COs.$0fIt is our job to protect the people#of Yellow Comet.$0fAm I wrong?$0f
No, Father. I understand.$0e$0e#Just be careful.$0fI'm going to see if I can unravel#this trap.$0f
Father, $0eI know what the enemy has#planned.$0fThey have a monstrous weapon called#a laser cannon.$0fIt fires a deadly laser up, down, left,#and right in a straight line.$0f
I see...$0e#Yet, $0eno matter the trap, I...$0f
Ooh! $0eI'm not finished yet!!!$0fIt's a laser cannon, but $0eit's#only a prototype. $0fIt can't just be fired at any time.$0fI think that's something we can use#to our advantage.$0f
That is helpful.$0e$0e#You are splendid, my child!$0f
Father!$0e I am NOT looking for#flattery! I'm trying to warn you!$0fIf the 10 cities in the upper right are#captured, $0ewe lose. $0eBe careful!$0f
Father, the enemy is preparing to fire#the laser! $0eLook out!$0f
Bad news, Adder.$0fOur troops got beat!$0f
Hsss! $0eThose Yellow Comet COs#aren't bad at all, are they?$0f
We've just lost 2 laser cannons!$0e#Why ain't you more mad?$0f
They were merely tools.$0e$0e#If necessary, $0ewe can build more.$0f
Yeah,$0e I guess so...$0f
More importantly, $0ehow are we going#to handle things from here on in?$0fFor now, let's retreat to the factory#and redraw our battle plans.$0fThis war is far from over.$0f
Father, it appears that the enemy has#withdrawn from the cities.$0f
Is that so?$0f
Yes, I visited one of them myself.$0e#They gave me a message for you.$0f"Thank you for saving us."$0f
......$0f
It made me think.$0e What if we hadn't#entered the enemy's trap?$0fWhat would have happened to all of#the people living in those cities?$0f
The safety of all of Yellow Comet#has been entrusted to us.$0fWhich means we sometimes have to#make painful decisions.$0fWe must always protect our citizens,$0e#regardless of the danger we face.$0f
I understand that now.$0f
Commander!$0e We've spotted someone#in the mountains to the north.$0fIt might be the Black Hole CO.$0f
Are you sure?$0e$0e#Quickly! $0ePrepare to pursue!$0f
Hold on, Father.$0e$0e We'll never catch#him if he's that far away.$0fIt's more important that we work on#reorganizing our troops. That's--$0f
We'll never know unless we try.$0e$0e#I am NOT letting him get away!$0f
But, Father...$0e#Father!$0fOooh! $0eHow I wish that he weren't#so reckless!$0f
No enemy can stand#before Kanbei!
Unforgivable. $0e$0eTen whole cities, stolen#away right before my eyes.$0f
Don't lose heart, Father.$0fWe're here to protect the citizens of#Yellow Comet. $0eThose were your words.$0f
Hmph! $0eThat is true.$0e$0e#I'm ashamed that you must remind me.$0f
The main thing is to protect#those cities.$0fLeave the laser to the rockets or the#mechs, and get the tanks to the cities.$0fIt's not like that thing can fire#every day.$0fIf we time it right, $0ewe should be#able to make it in time.$0f
Hm?$0e$0e#Where is my foe?$0fWhat is this? $0eThere is no enemy in#sight.$0fSonja,$0e what's the meaning of this?$0f
You're right, Father.$0e#There's no one here...$0fThis is an important piece of the#puzzle, though.$0fThe enemy must be targeting#this area.$0f
If they're here, Sonja,$0e show me where#they're hiding.$0fIf there is no enemy, there can be no#battle.$0fWe must move ahead to the next#battlefield.$0f
I suppose you're right,$0e$0e#and yet, $0esomething seems strange...$0f
I've no time for your stubbornness!$0fCome, Sonja!$0e$0e We must go!$0f
Hmmm...$0fYes, Father...$0e$0e#I understand.$0f
Just as I thought.$0e#Not a soul in sight.$0fDoes no one in Yellow Comet have#a brain?$0fOh well, $0eI guess I'll just march right#in and capture their HQ.$0f
Took your time getting here,#didn't you?$0f
Who?$0e#Sonja!?$0fYou're not supposed to be here! I was#told your army had moved on!$0f
Sorry to disappoint you.$0e$0e That intel#came from me, actually. $0eIt was false.$0fIt took some doing to get my father#and Sensei to agree to this plan, but...$0fI was beginning to wonder if you#would take the bait.$0f
Wait a minute...$0fAre you saying that YOU trapped#ME?$0f
Surrender.$0fThere are rockets on both sides of#you,$0e and artillery waits ahead.$0fIf you try to get to our HQ, you'll #be wiped out.$0f
I wonder...$0f
Huh?$0f
It's not like you're a combat specialist#or anything, right?$0fI really wonder if you can take me.$0f
......$0f
I have a pretty big army here.$0fIf I keep marching, I think I'll take#your HQ and win.$0fDon't you agree?$0f
Impossible.$0e$0e#My calculations are not wrong.$0fYour army will be destroyed before#you even touch our HQ.$0f
I think I can make it.$0e$0e#Care to bet on it?$0f
If you really want to try, $0ewho's going#to stop you?$0e$0e$0e Oh, that's right. $0eI am.$0fHow's this? $0eIf even one of your units#gets to our HQ, $0eyou win.$0fLet's determine which of us has the#better grasp on reality.$0f
Yay! $0eA game! A game!$0e$0e#Tee hee hee!$0f
I think that answers that question.$0f
Aaaah...$0e#I lost.$0fOh well,$0e I still have plenty of#pieces to play with.$0f
P-$0ePieces?!$0e$0e#I can't believe you said that!$0fThis isn't a game!$0e You're not on#some kind of playground!$0f
Oh, but it IS a game.$0fA wonderfully fun game between#you $0eand$0e me!$0fI know you feel the same way.$0e#Come on, $0eyou can tell me.$0f
Don't...$0e Don't be silly...$0e$0e#I'm...$0enothing like you, Lash.$0f
You're exactly like me.$0e$0e#You and I. $0eWe're the same.$0fYou're always thinking about it, right?$0e#Which move will bring victory?$0fYou enjoy war$0e$0e like a good#game of chess.$0f
......$0f
We're not different at all, Sonja.$0fYou'll feel it someday, $0ethe joy that#war brings.$0fWait...$0e You feel it now, don't you?$0e$0e#Oh, Sonja!$0e Tee hee hee! $0eToodles!$0f
Wait! $0eHold it!$0fAm I really...$0elike you?$0fI won't become you, Lash.$0fI can't...$0f
I never lose, Lash.
Tee hee hee! $0eI'm the winner!$0f
Well played. $0e$0eI underestimated your skill.$0e$0e#I need to rethink my strategy.$0fTo maximize my abilities, $0eI must utilize#my recon and mech units to gain the$0fbest vision range possible.$0fIf I can conceal my rockets in the#woods, $0ethey should be safe.$0fThen, if I lure the enemy in and fire,$0e#I should win. $0eMy strategy is flawless.$0fFog of War is my specialty.$0e She won't#beat me twice.$0f
Hm?$0e$0e You want to play again?$0e OK!$0e#I'll play as long as you want!$0e Tee hee!$0f
A peace treaty?$0fDid Black Hole really suggest that we#form a lasting peace with them?$0f
So it would seem, Daughter.$0fOur consecutive victories have taken#their toll on their army.$0fThey're proposing a peace treaty#that is favorable to Yellow Comet.$0f
Hmmm...$0fHow do you intend to respond,#Kanbei?$0f
Father, $0eit's a trap! $0eIt must be.$0e$0e#You must ignore it.$0f
I admit the possibility that this#might all be a trap.$0fHowever, $0eI intend to meet with them#and hear their proposal.$0f
Father!$0e$0e#You mustn't...$0f
I will not raise my sword against#one who has thrown his down.$0fThat is not the way of the#samurai.$0f
This is the location we agreed on.$0fThere's no one here.$0e$0e#It must be a trap.$0f
No, $0ewait...$0e$0e#There's someone...$0e There!$0f
......$0f
We came as promised, Adder.$0fI would hear your plan for peace.$0f
3...$0f
What?$0f
2...$0f
That--$0f
1...$0f
That isn't Adder!$0e$0e#It's a dummy!$0f
No!$0e$0e#Everyone! $0eRetreat!!$0f
0$0f
Heh heh heh...$0fRight on schedule. $0eThe road has been#cleared of all obstacles.$0fA leisurely march to the enemy HQ#would seem to be in order.$0f
Hate to tell you this, sonny,$0e#but that's not going to happen.$0f
...$0eHsss...$0e#So you survived.$0fIt matters not. $0eYou're too late.$0e$0e#Our preparations are complete.$0fThis pipe is the route by which#materials are transported to our$0ffactory. It's also an impenetrable,#indestructible wall.$0fSo why don't you twiddle your thumbs#or something while I go and capture$0fyour HQ.$0e#Heh heh heh...$0f
There's no scheme too base for#these scoundrels.$0f
Heh heh heh... $0eBase? $0eIt's not base,$0e#it's brilliant!$0fNow out of my way, you senile old#fool!$0e I've no time to spare for you.$0fYou may watch, though, $0ewhile I claim#my prize!$0f
Sensei! $0e$0eListen.$0fIt's as Adder said.$0e The pipe is#indestructible.$0fHowever, $0eif we concentrate our fire#on the seam, $0ewe might be able to open$0fa hole in it that will allow our units#to pass through.$0f
Mm...$0e#Well then, $0elet's give it a shot.$0f
What are you attempting to prove?$0fThere's no way that you can turn#the tables!$0e It's too late!$0f
This takes me back...$0fCompared to the battles of old, $0ethis is#nothing but a skirmish.$0fShall we get started then?$0f
Listen to me!$0e$0e Our goal is to#destroy the 3 minicannons.$0fIf we can take care of them,$0e the#foe will lose heart.$0e Move out!$0f
Our minicannons have been#destroyed? $0e$0eAll of them?$0fThere's been some sort of$0e#mistake...$0fUnder these conditions...$0ethere's no#way...we should have lost...$0f
Now listen here, Adder.$0fYou should really try hard to avoid#making me angry.$0f
What? $0eWhat did you do?$0f
I'm an old man.$0e$0e#I'm not looking for a fight.$0fI want nothing more than to relax and#bake my bones in the sun.$0fSo I'm warning you, $0estop now, while you#still can.$0fIf not, $0eI don't think I'll be able to#restrain myself...$0f
Hss...$0e#Hssssssss!$0f
Wow! $0eHe sure left in a hurry.$0f
Vintage Sensei! Well done!$0e#Well done indeed!$0f
Ah, time for a nap.
About time to turn over the reins to#someone younger, don't you think?$0f
Listen to me, Adder! $0eThis old man#still has some tricks up his sleeve.$0fKanbei believes in me, $0eand I won't#let him down.$0f
Oh, come now! $0eAre you saying you'd#like another shot at me, old man?$0fEven after I just beat you?$0f
That's right.$0e$0e#I've seen how you fight.$0fI believe that my battle copters can#hold off your tanks.$0fIf I tighten the defenses on my HQ$0e#and do something about that pipe...$0fI might not be a youngster anymore,$0e#but my CO Power is as hale as ever.$0fWatch yourself, sonny. This senior#citizen's just warming up!$0f
Interesting...$0e I believe I'll allow#you to show me this...$0epower of yours.$0f
That appears to be the lab on#the map.$0fIf my intel is accurate, $0ethey're working#on a new type of tank in there.$0fCalculating from Adder's skill and#the speed of our advance...$0fI estimate we have 18 days to#capture the lab or rout our foe.$0fIf we can do that, $0ewe might be able#to get our hands on the weapon specs.$0f
I see...$0fWe've no time to tarry then.$0fHm?$0e$0e It looks like the battle's#started without us.$0f
What?$0e$0e#Who in the world could it be?$0f
It's Black Hole on one side,$0e#but who are they fighting?$0f
My enemy's enemy is my ally...$0e#Or something like that.$0f
Prepare to advance!$0e$0e#We must not be late!$0f
There are no holes in my strategy!$0f
Let my armies take the field again!$0f
I guess I can take another shot at 'em.$0f
This is the location of Black Hole's#secret lab.$0fWe have to get this information#to Yellow Comet.$0f
That warship...$0fEveryone! $0eThose are our allies!$0e$0e#Let's join forces!$0f
That's...$0e#They've come to fight with us.$0fYes! $0eLet us combine our strength#and strike!$0f
Those troops...$0e#They don't appear to be the enemy's.$0fCombining our resources just may#give us a chance.$0f
Tomorrow's attack is key...$0e#It's our last chance to get that data!$0f
Hmph!$0e Day 17...$0e Today and tomorrow#are all we have left.$0f
Day 17 already?$0e We've got to wrap#this up by tomorrow, or else.$0f
These are...$0e#the plans for the new weapon!$0fYes! $0eWith these, we should be able#to produce that new tank design!$0f
You risked a lot to come to our aid.$0e#You have our gratitude.$0f
Don't mention it.$0e#We gotta help each other out.$0fI'm gonna head on back to Blue Moon#for the time being.$0fI'll be back with the Bearded One#later. $0eTalk to you then.$0f
No, $0ethank YOU.$0e You helped me out#of a jam.$0fIt's time for me to return to Orange#Star, $0ebut we'll meet again.$0f
Left without offering a name...$0e Is that#what passes for manners these days?$0f
Don't worry, $0eI'm sure we'll#be meeting again.$0f
My thoughts exactly.$0e$0e#We'll be meeting again.$0f
Kanbei's army grows#mightier with every day!
We can't afford to take#Black Hole lightly.
A new type of tank...#Glad we got those plans.
Orange Star troops here?$0e#What is Flak doing?$0fNot that it mattered, $0eI could defeat#any number of countries.$0e Heh, heh...$0f
This is no good.$0f
Sonja, $0edid you gain any strategic#insight from that battle?$0f
Let me see...$0e On this terrain, $0esplitting#up our troops is a bad idea.$0fWe should build up our strike force$0e#and then attack in one fell swoop.$0fIf possible, $0esupport from air units#would really help.$0f
That Orange Star CO was fighting#under unfavorable terrain conditions$0fin a strange country.$0fWe're responsible for the loss#of her troops.$0fWe must do better!$0f
I will not rest until every last#invader is driven from our soil!$0f
They...$0e They've come this far?$0e#That must mean...$0f
Adder...$0f
Who's there?$0e#Who dares address me?!?$0fOh! $0e$0eHawke!$0e#It's you.$0f
It appears that you're behind#schedule. $0eWhat've you been doing?$0f
I$0e-I've been delayed. $0eBut only#slightly. $0eIt's no problem.$0fWe'll be in control of this tiny#country soon. $0eYou have my word.$0f
Do you understand $0ewhat it means#that I am here, $0eAdder?$0f
If-$0eIf I win...$0e#If I win here, $0ethere's no problem!$0fThat's correct, isn't it?$0f
Hmmm...$0e$0e IF you win.$0f
At last, $0ethe enemy's factory.$0fIf we claim victory here, $0ewe can#drive the enemy out of our homeland.$0f
Yes!$0e#Let it begin!$0f
Commander! $0e$0eThe leader of the#Blue Moon Army to see you.$0f
It's been a long time, Kanbei.$0f
If it isn't Olaf!$0e$0e#Why are you here?$0f
I've brought along my men to lend#Yellow Comet my aid.$0fThe Black Hole Army threatens#us all.$0fBlue Moon will stand beside you#in this fight.$0f
Ah! $0eKanbei is grateful!$0fWith the power of Blue Moon#beside us, $0ewe cannot lose!$0f
Commander! $0e$0eThe leader of the#Orange Star Army to see you.$0f
Long time, no see, Kanbei.$0f
Is that you, Nell?$0e#What brings you here?$0f
I would like to propose an alliance#between your country and ours.$0fThe Black Hole Army is our#mutual enemy.$0f
Ah! $0eKanbei is grateful!$0fYellow Comet and Orange Star!$0e#Black Hole is a good as defeated!$0f
Attention! $0eWe're moving out for#Yellow Comet! $0eLet's go!$0f
I hope my infantry is up to the task.$0f
I'm gonna break Black Hole like a twig!$0f
If I take the field,$0e our victory#is assured!$0f
Hm? $0eMe? $0eYou're sure now?$0f
People of Yellow Comet, $0elet's work#together and do our best!$0f
It is I who shall deal the final blow!$0f
Two against one?$0e#The odds are in our favor.$0f
Now is the moment of truth.$0f
It looks like it's our turn.$0e$0e#Let's move 'em out!$0f
March! $0eLet them behold the#might of the Blue Moon Army!$0f
The factory...$0e#It's completely...$0fIt's the blasted weather!$0e$0e#That was the problem!$0fHssss!$0f
The Black Hole Army's in full retreat.$0fYes!$0e#Father!$0e Sensei!$0fWe won! $0eWe won!$0f
That we did.$0e#And an impressive win it was.$0f
Today's battle will long be#remembered.$0fThrough our combined efforts,#our common foe was defeated.$0fI offer my gratitude.$0e$0e#Thank you for your aid.$0f
Don't be foolish!$0e#You would've done the same for us.$0fActually, $0eBlack Hole was foolish#enough to attack us as well.$0fOf course, we defeated them soundly.$0e#With...some help from Orange Star.$0fWell, well... $0eHere come Nell and her#troops now.$0f
Long time, no see, Kanbei.$0f
It seems that you have crossed#swords with the Black Hole Army, too.$0f
Yes, we have.$0fThe strength of the Black Hole Army#is immeasurable.$0fEspecially the CO named Hawke.$0fWe've heard reports that he has#Green Earth on the verge of defeat.$0f
Impossible!$0f
There's no time to spare. $0e$0eWe must#get to Green Earth on the double!$0f
Yellow Comet is with you!$0e$0e#Our strength is yours!$0fIf we all stand together,$0e#there is nothing we need fear!$0f
A friend in need $0eis a friend indeed.$0fNow, however, $0ewe must hurry to the#next battlefield.$0f
The next battlefield?$0f
Yes.$0fBlack Hole's power is immeasurable.$0fEven now, they are attacking your#neighbor, Blue Moon.$0f
What?$0f
We have no time to spare.$0fWe must march to Blue Moon's aid#immediately!$0f
Yellow Comet is with you!$0e$0e#Our strength is yours!$0fIf we all stand together, $0e#there is nothing we need fear!$0f
Wahoo! I won!
All right! Teamwork#wins again!
Now THAT was a#beating!
Ha ha ha!#Victory is ours!
I'm all tuckered out.#Think I'll get some shut-eye.
Congratulations,#Yellow Comet!
Splendid! Kanbei#is pleased!
And so, peace returns#to Yellow Comet.
Now we can take things#nice and slow again...
Even with aid from our allies,#we suffer defeat. $0eNever!$0fSonja, $0ewe will draw up battle plans#anew. $0eThis fight is not over!$0f
Yes, Father.$0e$0e#We must liberate our country.$0fI see it...$0e On this map, controlling#the skies is essential to victory.$0fLet's halt the enemy advance on the#ground, $0ethen reclaim the airport.$0f
What keen eyesight you have, Sonja.$0fWith bombers, $0ewe can assault their#minicannons and that pipeline.$0f
This time we must win!$0e#Fall in, $0eand follow me!$0f
Lord Sturm,$0e the enemy army...$0f
So they've arrived...$0f
I'll smash 'em.$0e$0e#Lord Sturm, let me have 'em.$0f
Flak will make a mess of it, sir.$0e$0e#Let me take command.$0f
The command is...$0emine.$0f
What?$0f
I will ascertain how strong they've#become with my own eyes.$0fYou wretches report to the missile#platform and assist Lash.$0f
Understood.$0f
Yes, sir.$0f
Good riddance.$0fPathetic fools.$0e They have served me#poorly.$0fWhen this is finished,$0e I will#make...adjustments.$0f
Here we are at last.$0e#The Black Hole Army's citadel.$0f
I don't care what they call it.$0fAll I know is, everything they pillaged#from Orange Star is here.$0f
That's been confirmed by our allies,#too.$0f
So if we can capture this place,$0e#we can get all of our money back!$0f
I'm not so sure of that.$0f
What do you mean, Nell?$0f
Just because it was all sent here#doesn't mean it's still here.$0f
Are you saying they might have#moved it all to another location?$0f
What makes you think that?$0f
We gotta assume they weren't#gathering it just for kicks.$0fThey've got something planned, and#more 'n likely, they've moved all$0four stuff to where they need it.$0fThat sound 'bout right, Nell?$0f
Grit's exactly right.$0fWhich means this battle is also about#deciphering their ultimate plan.$0f
Hmmm...$0fRegardless, $0ewe must still attack.$0e$0e#The longer we wait,$0fthe stronger their defenses become.$0e$0e#Our target...$0f
Our objective is to destroy the#3 Black Cannons.$0f
Hm?$0e Just the cannons? $0eAre you sure,#Sonja?$0f
If we eliminate those, $0ewe should#be able to rout our foe.$0fIf there's nothing here for#them to protect, they'll run.$0f
Ah.$0e$0e And if they do...$0fThat would tell us whether or not#this was their true headquarters.$0f
I see...$0f
That's brilliant, Commander Sonja!$0f
As we can see, indirect fire will be#useful in this battle.$0fThe other vital elements will be#selecting the right first CO...$0f...and using decoys effectively#against the Black Cannons.$0f
OK,$0e let's go!$0f
Lord Sturm!$0e$0e#The Black Cannons have been--$0f
Did you leak intel on the missile#platform to the enemy as I ordered?$0f
Yes, sir.$0fWe let one soldier be captured.$0e$0e#He will tell all in his interrogation.$0f
Good.$0e It's time to end this game.$0e$0e#Order all units to the platform.$0f
Yes, sir!$0f
They will follow the trail all the way#to the missile platform.$0fMy best troops will greet them there#with a storm of death.$0fThen, $0ebefore their very eyes,$0e#I will launch our missiles.$0f
The enemy's constructing a missile#platform?$0f
Yes.$0fThey're planning to launch missiles#at Cosmo Land and other continents.$0f
Is this intel reliable?$0f
We heard it from a captured soldier.$0fIntel we gathered on our own confirms#his story.$0f
What are we waiting for?$0e$0e We have#to attack that missile platform!$0f
It's not that simple, Andy.$0f
It's not? $0eWhy?$0f
Cause it might be a trap.$0f
You've confirmed the intel, correct?$0f
Would a soldier who's fought so long#break so easily?$0e I wonder...$0f
I think it's best to assume that#it's a snare.$0f
Well, even so, we can't sit in#port forever.$0fWe need to end this quickly while#troop morale is high.$0f
Hmmm...$0f
Aaaaah! $0eI can't stand it!$0e How#long are we gonna talk about this?!$0fIf the enemy's at the missile platform,$0e#then let's blast it to bits!$0f
Andy, $0eyour mouth's gettin' ahead#of your brain again...$0f
No.$0e I think the boy's got the right#idea.$0f
Huh?$0f
I concur.$0e$0e We must attack sometime.$0fIf they're waiting for us at the#platform, $0eit saves us the time$0fand the annoyance of looking#for them.$0f
I get what you're sayin'.$0fIf you're looking for crawdads,#you gotta turn over some rocks.$0fThat's a pretty sound principle.$0f
I hear no objections.$0fThen let us begin our advance#on the missile platform.$0f
Waaaahooooo!$0e Let's get 'em!$0f
I'll win next time, too!
Ha ha ha...#Piece of cake!
Next time's for real.#I won't lose focus.
We do not know what#it means to lose!
Yaaaawn... My, oh my.#One more nut to crack.
I'll do my best#next time, too!
My blade is eager for#the next challenge!
Our enemy is tough,#but we won't lose!
My chute's all packed#for the final jump!
This is the beginning#of the end.
I'm just glad I#survived that...
For our troops' sake,#we must end this!
It is the Black Hole citadel after#all.$0e It's supposed to be tough.$0f
I did notice one thing, $0ethe enemy units#aren't coming out past the pipe.$0fIn that case, if we hit the pipe#from the outside with indirect fire...$0f
You've done it, again, Sonja!$0f
Indirect fire? $0eSounds like you're#playing my song.$0f
Rockets are vehicular units, too.$0e$0e#So I believe I'll be useful here.$0fYou know, the Black Cannon targets#the most expensive units first.$0fLet's capitalize on that and make#good use of decoys.$0f
All right! $0eWe'll definitely win next time!$0e#C'mon, everybody!$0e We can do it!$0f
It's the Black Hole citadel after#all. $0eIt's supposed to be tough.$0f
Uh...Commander Nell?$0e What do we#need to do to win?$0f
Colin!$0e If you have questions of#strategy,$0e you should be asking me!$0f
Let's see...$0e The troops guarding both#flanks should grab those bases.$0fIf we can defeat their infantry, we#won't have to worry about any$0fproperties being captured.$0f
Is no one listening to me!?$0f
I don't think we need pursue their#naval units too far.$0fAfter all, they've no means of#refueling.$0f
The units guarding the center position#have the biggest burden.$0fThey'll have to keep their wits about#them to avoid being routed.$0f
Then that is the role for Kanbei!$0e#I will show the might of my troops!$0f
All right! $0eWe'll definitely win next time!$0e#C'mon, everybody!$0e We can do it!$0f
Lash,$0e is construction on the missile#platform completed?$0f
I think it's going to take a little#more time.$0f
How much?$0f
About 3...$0e#No, about 40 days.$0e Maybe...$0f
I will not wait that long.$0e$0e#Finish it in 30 days.$0f
......$0f
Do you understand?$0f
OK, $0eI'll try...$0f
And how is the Deathray?$0f
It's fine.$0e$0e You can use it now.$0e#I even fixed it, too!$0fNow it won't damage our troops#when it's fired.$0fIt does need 7 days to build up#enough energy to fire, though.$0f
Hm.$0e$0e#7 days...$0e$0e I'll not forget.$0f
Hey! I think I see it!$0e$0e#The missile platform!$0f
Here we go...$0f
Look what I've found.$0f
You...$0e You're Sturm!$0f
And you're the little girl who likes#playing with soldiers.$0fHere you are again, sneaking around#where you don't belong.$0f
Sonja's not alone.$0fWe're all here.$0e$0e#Different place, $0esame cast.$0f
You're all here?$0e$0e#Then you shall all taste despair.$0fFor you shall witness the destruction#of your world when my missile strikes.$0f
As long as we're alive,$0e#that will never happen.$0f
Empty words, worm.$0e The missile#platform is beyond your reach.$0f
What is that supposed to mean?$0f
Enough talk.$0e$0e#I would see your $0epower.$0f
Hey! $0eWait a...$0e$0e#Beyond our reach? $0eIt's right...$0f
Ohmigosh!$0e We've just received report#of a giant laser blocking the platform!$0f
That would explain why the old boy#was so doggone sure of himself.$0f
In that case, $0ewe should strike now,#while we have the chance.$0f
It doesn't look like we'll be able#to avoid that contraption.$0f
So we weaken his defenses,$0e attack#the platform,$0e and stop the launch...$0f
That sounds like a plan I can#get behind!$0f
Let us aim for the laser.$0e$0e#Move out, everyone!$0f
You are fodder for my laser.$0f
Lord Sturm!$0fJust as promised,$0e the missile will#be ready to launch tomorrow!$0f
Well done.$0e$0e We shall use it to#salute the Black Hole Army.$0f
Tee hee hee!$0e I can't wait!$0e It'll be#like a big fireworks display!$0f
My...$0e My Deathray...$0f
The enemy's weakening!$0e$0e Attack#the platform, and halt that launch!$0f
C'mon, everybody!$0e Let's go!$0f
All right!$0e$0e#That platform's goin' down!$0f
Understood!$0e$0e All right, troops.$0e#Focus your fire on that platform!$0f
Leave this to me.$0e$0e#I'll show you how it's done!$0f
Listen up, y'all!$0e$0e#Let's mop up and skedaddle for home!$0f
Ye-$0eYes, ma'am!$0e$0e#Quickly! $0eLet's hit the platform!$0f
We will do our duty.$0e$0e#Soldiers!$0e Attack!!!$0f
This is the end.$0e$0e#Our goal is that launch platform!$0f
Let's put an end to this once#and for all. $0eAll together now.$0f
The moment of victory is at hand.$0e$0e#The platform must fall! $0eHit it now!!!$0f
We're almost there.$0e$0e#Stand tall, sailors!$0f
Hit that platform with everything#you've got!$0e Nothing else matters!$0f
Lord Sturm!$0e$0e#The missile platform... $0eIt won't hold!$0f

Good riddance.$0f

......$0f
Lord...Sturm...$0e#Hawke, $0ewhat have you done?$0f
As of now,$0e I am the commander-#in-chief of the Black Hole Army.$0fIf you have anything to say,$0e#come forward, or hold your peace.$0f
......$0f
What's this all about?$0e#Weren't you in league with Sturm?$0f
I wanted to test my power.$0e#To see how strong I could become.$0fI'm interested in nothing save myself.$0e$0e#That was my purpose.$0e Nothing more.$0f
In any case, $0eyou saved us all.$0f

Hold it, Hawke!$0fWhat you've done to Macro Land is#unforgivable!$0f
But...$0fYou saved me...$0e$0e#You saved all of us.$0e$0e Thanks.$0f
Hah...$0fThough the Black Hole Army's gone,$0e#you would do well to remember me.$0fUntil next time!$0f
He had his say and left...$0e#I wonder if he'll attack again someday.$0f
It's hard to say.$0fIf he does, though,$0e we'll just#have to drive him back.$0f
We'll have to spend some time#preparing if we're going to do that.$0f
We must help heal the battle-ravaged#soil of Macro Land as well.$0f
All of that can wait!$0e We won!#$0e$0e...Well, we did, didn't we?$0f
Yes, we did.$0f
Well, $0elet's celebrate!$0e#It's party time! $0ePaaaarty!$0f

Macro Land was free at last, and#the Black Hole Army had been driven#from its shores.##But peace can be a fragile thing.#Be vigilant... Be brave.
Hey, there! You all look#like you're in good spirits!$0f
Isn't that...$0e Hey, it's Hachi!$0e$0e#What brings you all the way out here?$0f
Well...$0eI saw all of you in the heat#of battle, $0eand it got to me!$0fI just had to come out and walk#a battlefield again.$0f
The battle's over, sir...$0f
Don't you believe it, laddie!$0fThere's always the War Room, $0eand#other modes to boot!$0f
Wo ho ho ho.$0e$0e#Long time, no see, Hachi.$0f
Well I'll be... $0eSensei!$0e$0e#Good to see you looking so fit.$0f
Do you know Sensei?$0f
Yes. $0eHachi and I were both pupils#under Sensei's tutelage.$0fI remember, $0eSensei was at times#gentle, $0eat times harsher than...$0f
Oh, c'mon, Kanbei!$0e#No one wants to hear about that!$0fTell me, $0ewhat are everyone's plans#from here on out?$0f
I will return to my demolished hometown#and start rebuilding.$0f
Well, $0ein that case, I'm going#to help out, too.$0f

Yo, Grit.$0e$0e Are you ever coming#back to Orange Star?$0f

Yeah...$0f
Let's see...$0e#I guess I'm off to the academy.$0f
With this out of the way,$0e maybe you#can work on improving your grades.$0f
Hey!$0e Just because we attended the#same school doesn't give you$0fthe right to say stuff like that!$0fBesides, $0emy diligence may have made#the difference here today!$0e Right?$0f
Hee hee...$0e#Right.$0f
As for us...$0e We're going to be busy#setting things right for Green Earth.$0f
Yes, we are.$0e$0e I'll go with you now#so we can get started right away.$0f
Afterward, $0ewe strengthen our air#force!$0fWe have to do better in the future#to avoid things like this.$0fAnd that means you, too, Jess.$0e I'm#going to work you harder than ever!$0f
That's fine.$0e But there's something#else we really need to do.$0fAnd that's to make you into something#other than a one-dimensional flyboy!$0f
I've been wanting to do this for a long#time. $0eYou and me, one on one.$0fAs soon as we get back,$0e I want you on#the training field.$0fWe'll see who's better once and#for all!!!$0f
It will be my pleasure.$0f
Ohhhh...$0e$0e#Not this again...$0e Somebody save me.$0f
Ha ha ha...$0e Everyone sure has a#lot of work to do.$0f
Hey...$0e#What about the party?$0f

OK.$0e When we get back, make sure#you stop by the store and see me!$0f
Good-bye, everyone!$0e$0e#Thanks!$0e$0e Thanks for everything!$0f
Aw, man!$0e#This stinks!$0f
I'll never lose to#the likes of Sturm!
He can keep trying, but#he'll never beat us!
That just about wraps#things up.
In the end, Olaf#stands victorious!
I sure hope this#really is the end.
Now that was a#learning experience.
A long and difficult#war it was.
Old soldiers don't die.#They fade away. Bye!
Now we rebuild the#continent!
We're the best. No#one can defeat us.
Smooth sailing at last.#It's over.
I can finally send#my troops home.
Oh, no! $0eA missile!$0e It's launching!$0f
We didn't make it in time...$0f
We need to fall back and regroup.$0fThat was bad, $0ebut surely the#whole world hasn't been destroyed.$0fWe can't let them fire another missile#though. We have to stop them.$0f
We need to rethink our strategy.$0f
Sonja,$0e#do you have any good ideas?$0f
I do, Father.$0e Leave it to me.$0fThat Deathray is truly powerful,$0e#but only in one direction.$0fWhile the CO in the middle stops#the enemy on that small isle...$0f
this#really is the end.
ie.#They fade away. Bye!
If you need power, I'm your man!$0e#I'll slice that pipe like butter!$0f
Don't y'all forget, I'm the best#marksman there ever was.$0fAnd I got some mighty big guns#around here somewhere!$0f
I know I'm no Commander Grit,$0e but#I think I can be of service, too.$0f
Lest you forget, I do have the best#bombers available.$0f
You're all so trustworthy.$0fI have every confidence that victory#will be ours!$0f
Oh, no! $0eFrom the platform! $0eA missile!$0f
We didn't make it in time...$0f
We need to fall back and regroup.$0fThat was bad, $0ebut surely the#whole world hasn't been destroyed.$0fWe can't let them fire another missile#though. We have to stop them.$0f
We need to rethink our strategy.$0f
Sonja,$0e#do you have any good ideas?$0f
I do, Father.$0e Leave it to me.$0fFirst, the army in the center must#attack the Black Cannon from behind.$0fOnce the troops on the right and#left are assured safe passage,$0feveryone can advance and attack at#once.$0fDon't forget about the laser, either.#It fires every 7 days.$0f
The pipe seam, $0eBlack Cannon,$0e#minicannon, $0eDeathray...$0fStrong firepower is one thing that#would give us an advantage.$0f
If you need power, I'm your man!$0e#I'll slice that pipe like butter!$0f
Don't y'all forget, I'm the best#marksman there ever was.$0fAnd I got some mighty big guns#around here somewhere!$0f
Yellow Comet has Kanbei!$0e#My superior troops are matchless!$0f
Lest you forget, I do have the best#bombers available.$0f
You're all so trustworthy.$0fWe've made it this far,$0e and I have#every confidence victory will be ours!$0fThe Black Hole Army is on the brink#of defeat!$0e Let's push 'em over!$0f

C'mon in!$0fWelcome to Battle Maps! My name's#Hachi. Pleased to meet you!$0fThis is where you use points earned#in Campaign mode or the War Room.$0fI've got maps and COs you can use#in Free Battle or the War Room, and...$0fWell, I've got all kinds of stuff! #Go ahead, take a look around!$0f
Back again?$0e#What can I do for you?$0f
I'm outta everything.#My shelves are bare.$0fIt's a sign of my consummate#salesmanship.$0f
Came back, eh? Well, I've#got everything you need.$0f
Well, now! You're back again!$0fMust mean you made some money#in Campaign mode or the War Room.$0fWhat'll it be today?$0f
Hey there, soldier!$0fDon't like what you see? Finish more#of the campaign, and try again.$0fWell, do you need anything today?$0f
Look who's here!$0fHey, listen. Even if you buy all the#maps I have in stock, come back again.$0fI'm always getting new supplies.$0fGo ahead and take a look at#what came in today.$0f
Come on in!$0fHey, have you cleared#Campaign mode?$0fThere's more to it than#just clearing it once, you know.$0fRumor has it that there's#another, harder campaign...$0fAh, but I'm talking too much!#Are you going to buy anything today?$0f
Hey! If you're coming in,#come in! And shut the door!$0fBy the way, which CO have you#been using?$0fUsing the same CO over and#over isn't very impressive.$0fIf you want to earn a higher score,#you should try someone new.$0fEnough of that$3b what'll#it be today?$0f
Well, back again, are you?$0fSay, have you tried#the Hard Campaign?$0fAll you need to do is#press SELECT before$0fyou start the Campaign Mode.$0fThe Hard Campaign is just#the challenge you need, soldier!$0fIt'll toughen you up, and the#payoff is bigger, too!$0fIf you're ever short of funds,#give the Hard Campaign a shot.$0fSo, go make some cash, and#spend it all here! Heh heh heh!$0f
Hey, it's my favorite soldier!$0fSay, are you making the best use#of your CO Powers?$0fYou're not ignoring normal powers#in favor of super powers, are you?$0fIn some situations, normal powers#are better than super ones!$0fAny energy left after you use a#normal power doesn't just disappear.$0fDidn't you notice that?$0fOh yeah, but you don't build up any#energy when you're using CO Powers.$0fLife ain't that easy, soldier!$0fOops! You know, my mouth's gonna get#me in hot water one of these days!$0fEnough of this chitchat. Are you#buying something, or what?$0f
C'mon in!$0fTell me, have you ever been in#a battle with Jess?$0fShe and Eagle are always squabbling,#but that shows how close they are!$0fLet me tell you, that gal's the real#deal. Gives me goose bumps!$0fShe's a bit like Max in ability, but#there's nothing second-rate about$0fher long-range units. And her air#and naval units?$0fWell, they might not be the best, but#she doesn't make many mistakes.$0fHer CO Power is a little plain. After#all, supplying units isn't that glamorous.$0fBut it resupplies air and naval units,#too! She is amazing, isn't she?$0fThere I go, rattling on like an old fool!#Let's get down to business!$0f
Well now, look what the#cat dragged in !$0fAre you familiar with Sensei?$0fHe's a bit long in the tooth now,#but in his day, he was something else!$0fHe sure taught me a thing or two...#Ah, now I'm getting all misty!$0fAnyway, Kanbei and I owe most of#our success to that old man.$0fYou're not impressed with his CO#Power, right? If you think increasing$0fthe number of mech and infantry units#is something to sneeze at,$0fthen you're still wet behind the ears!$0fYou've got to consider WHY he makes#those 9 HP units land!$0fThat's enough chitchat!#Get to buying!$0f
Mopping 'em up out there?$0fI'm happy to see Nell in such#fine spirits lately.$0fAnd the youngsters! Sami and#Andy are both growing so fast!.$0fI think our country's safe with#this new generation on guard...$0fOh, listen to this old fool prattle on!#Let's talk business!$0f
Oh, it's you, again!$0fHave you met the new kid,#Colin?$0fHe's Blue Moon's little rich boy,#but his talent is undeniable.$0fHis special power? Whew...$0fIf you use the Power of Money right,#it'll give you the strength to topple$0feven Sturm with ease.#Did you know that?$0fHis normal firepower is low, so it's#a question of overwhelming opponents$0fwith sheer numbers or saving cash for#CO Powers. Tough strategic choice!$0fEnough with the small talk!#Why don't you have a look around?$0f
Good to see you again!$0fHave you ever faced Flak, that#big ape with the Black Hole Army?$0fHis attacks are so haphazard. Power#means zip if you can't hit the target!$0fI bet he'd be a difficult CO to use#in the War Room.$0fSo, are you ready to talk business?#I'm all out of gossip for now!$0f
Hey! Quite the military posture#you're getting there!$0fHave you met Lash yet? Yep, she's#that girl with the hair out to there!$0fI hear she's the one who designed#Black Hole's new cannon and laser!$0fWhat a waste of talent!$0fIf she's gotta make stuff, why can't#she make a pool for my house!?$0fWhat's that got to do with me, right?#Let's get some business done!$0f
You've heard of Adder, right?$0fHe's not much for offense, and he#doesn't have any specialty troops.$0fThe thing is, he's got no weak points,#either! That's the trouble right there!$0fPlus, he stores up energy for his CO#Power like there's no tomorrow!$0fBut if he uses it over and over#again, it takes longer to build up.$0fHow's that for some juicy intel?$0fShow me some gratitude and#whip out your wallet!$0f
Tell me, have you ever seen Hawke?#He's a CO in the Black Hole Army.$0fHe's one bad hombre, and no fooling.#He's leagues above most other COs.$0fAren't many who've gone head-to-#head with him and walked away$0fa winner, you know? Of course,#I'd teach him some manners, but...$0fAh, why don't I just shut my yap#and let you do some shopping, eh?$0f
Is that what you're after?#$16
